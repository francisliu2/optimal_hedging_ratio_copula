The introduction of derivatives on Bitcoin enables investors to hedge risk exposures in cryptocurrencies.
Because of volatility swings and jumps in cryptocurrency prices, the traditional variance-based approach to obtain hedge ratios is infeasible.
As a consequence, we consider two extensions of the traditional approach: first, different dependence structures are modelled by different copulae, such as the Gaussian, Student-t, Normal Inverse Gaussian and Archimedean copulae;
second, different risk measures, such as value-at-risk, expected shortfall and spectral risk measures are employed to find the optimal hedge ratio.
Extensive out-of-sample tests  in the time period December 2017 until May 2021 give insights in the practice of hedging various cryptos and crypto indices, including Bitcoin,  Ethereum, Cardano, the CRIX index and a number of
crypto-portfolios.
Evidence shows that BTC futures can effectively hedge BTC and BTC-involved indices.
This promising result is consistent across different risk measures and
copulae except for the Frank copula.
On the other hand, we observe complex and diverse dependence

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}
Cryptocurrencies (CC's) are a fast-growing asset class,
with many more CCs now available on the market since the first
cryptocurrency Bitcoin (BTC) surfaced \citep{nakamoto2009}.
In response to the rapid development of the CC market, the CME Group
launched exchange-traded BTC futures contracts in December
2017.
At the time of writing, the CME is the only exchanged offering
regulated crypto futures. 
The average daily volume and open interest of the CME BTC futures are
\$2,518 M and \$2,836 M respectively.\natp{\em [Add an approximate
  date. Where are these figures from?]}
% \natp{\em [I think the following sentence can be deleted. Readers of
%   Quantitative Finance know the advantages of futures contracts.]}
Because it is regulated, the CME BTC derivatives market  
is an attractive way for institutional
investors to participate in or manage their exposure in the crypto
market.
%The price
%of BTC even surged to \$ 64,500 in mid-April 2021 up by 460\% from
% from \$ 11,500 six months earlier in October 2020 and up by 850\%
% from a year earlier. Just a month later, by mid-May 2021, the price
% had fallen to \$ 50,000, a one-month return of -22.5\%.
 % see tiingo_btc.csv 
As more individual and institutional investors are adding CCs and CC
derivatives to their portfolios, the need to understand
downside risks and find suitable ways to hedge against extreme risks
is created. 
Fom a risk management perspective, the roller-coaster ride
of crypto prices may create significant basis risk, even when using
simple hedges involving crypto portfolios and BTC futures. This
requires analysing the dependence structure of cryptos and
futures beyond linear correlation. 

In this paper, we examine static hedges of crypto portfolios
with Bitcoin futures. Owing to the asymmetry of crypto returns as
well as the occurrence of extreme events, we consider different 
dependence structures via a variety of copula models. We then optimise
the hedge ratio using different risk measures. A similar study was
conducted by \citep{barbi2014copula} for equity and FX portfolios.
\citet{barbi2014copula}'s work is based on \citet{cherubini2011copula}
to derive the distribution of linear combinations of margins with
copulae describing the dependence structure. We slightly extend their
results and come up with a formula for the linear combination of
random variables for our purpose.

The hedge ratio is the appropriate amount of futures contracts to hold
in order to eliminate the risk exposure in the underlying security.   
The determination of the optimal hedge ratio relies primarily
on the dependence between BTC and futures prices.
%In this paper, we investigate the performance of different copulae and
%risk measures in hedging Bitcoin and CRIX with Bitcoin
%futures. {\color{blue} only this portfolio?} \natp{\em [$\leftarrow$ Make this the first sentence of the paper!]}
Financial asset returns have long known to be non-Gaussian, see e.g.\
\citep{fama1963mandelbrot,Cont2001}. Specifically, Gaussian models
cannot produce the heavy tails and the asymmetry observed in 
asset returns, which in turn implies a consistent underestimation of
financial risks. 
%\natp{\cite{Cont2001}}. \natp{\em [non-Gaussian is not
  %very specific, a uniform r.v.\ is also non-Gaussian. Try to express
 % this in a more meaningful way, e.g.\ Financial data are known to
  %exhibit more extreme events than a normal distribution can capture.]}
Therefore, to minimize downside risk, one cannot solely rely on
second-order moment calculations. Moreover, variance as a risk measure
does not account for the variety of investors' utility functions. In
particular, it is known that  
investors are tail-risk averse, see \cite{menezes1980increasing}.
Copulae provide the flexibility to model multivariate random variables
separately by their margins and dependence structure.
The concept of copulae was originally developed (but not under this
name) by Wassily Hoeffding \citep{hoeffding1940masstabinvariante}
and later popularised by the work of Abe Sklar \citep{Sklar1959}.

Different risk measures account for investors' risk attitudes.
They serve as loss functions in the search process of the optimal
hedge ratio. Of the vast literature discussing the relationship between
risk measures and investors' risk attitudes, we refer readers to
\citet{artzner1999coherent} for an axiomatic 
approach of risk measure construction;
\citet{embrechts2002correlation} for reasoning of using expected
shortfall (ES) and spectral risk measures (SRM) in addition to
value-at-risk (VaR);
\citet{Acerbi2002} for direct linkages between risk measures and
investor's risk attitudes using the concept of a ``risk aversion
function''. 


In order to capture a variety of risk preferences, in addition to
variance, we include the risk measures value-at-risk (VaR), expected
shortfall (ES), and spectral risk measures (SRM). 
%Coherency is a very natural property that suggest diversification will reduce risk.
VaR is widely used by the finance industry and easy to understand. 
ES and SRM are chosen because of their coherence property, in
particular, they recognize diversification benefits.
SRM can also be directly related to an individual's utility function.
Examples are the exponential SRM and power SRM introduced by
\citet{dowd2008spectral}. 
%\natp{\em [Careful with wording! The
 %hedge is not optimal. The optimal hedge ratio that minimises a risk measure is chosen.]}
%In particular, the SRM proposed by \citet{Acerbi2002} accounts for investors' utility (i.e. risk preference).
%SRM is a weighted average of the quantities of a loss distribution, the weights of which depend on the investor's risk-aversion. In other words, 

% \natp{\em [This needs not go in the introduction. Just briefly mention the risk measures, and possibly that ES and SRM are chosen because of their coherence.]}
%\medskip
%
%\natp{The introduction should go along the lines:
%  \begin{itemize}
%  \item 1-2 sentence: Which problem is solved in this paper?
%  \item Background Bitcoin: Growth, but roller-coaster ride, institutional investment,
%    exchange-traded futures (the exchange is important!) (5 sentences,
%    with references!)
%  \item Significant tail risks and basis risk lead to the need to
%    investigate even static hedges (=futures) with more refined
%    methods than minimum-variance based (reference to Ederington
%    here; this uses variance as risk measure and correlation as
%    dependence measure).
%  \item To capture empirical properties, extend to other risk measures
%    and dependence models. 
%  \end{itemize}
%  }

In this work, we study the effectiveness of hedging various CC's and
crypto indices using Bitcoin futures under copula models and different
risk preferences. 
In an extensive back-test,\footnote{We thank the data provider
  Tiingo (\href{https://www.tiingo.com/}{https://www.tiingo.com/}) for
  providing the crypto price data.}
 we find the ability of the BTC futures to hedge BTC and BTC-related
 indices promising, regardless of the choices of the copula (with the
 exception of the Frank copula) and risk measure. 
On the other hand, the ability of BTC futures to hedge other cryptos
\natp{depends on various factors, such as ... (was: is inconclusive)
  {\em [Something more useful should be said here. ``is inconclusive''
  means: ``stop reading here'']}}. 
Instead of suggesting a particular copula or risk measures, we discuss
the characteristics of different settings.  


The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the notion of
an optimal hedge ratio; Section 3 decribes the method of estimation of
copulae; Section 4 provides the empirical result; Section 5
concludes.

\section{Supplementary Material: Intraday Hedging}

\natp{\em [This section must be shortened significantly. It is not
  necessary to repeat everything, just point out the differences.]}

This supplementary material extends the study in the main body to an
intraday rebalancing setting. \natp{\em [Do we really have intraay
  rebalancing? Or just intraday P\&L? If rebalancing, then clarify.]}
The idea is to infer if the findings from the daily setting extend to
intraday data. 

\natp{\em [From my point of view there is no need to motivate intraday
  risk management.]}
Studying the intraday hedge is familiar to academia, 
e.g. \citet{harris2010limits}, \citet{dungey2013impact},
\citet{tse2013does}, and \citet{sheu2014incremental}.

Numerous studies on the crypto market are associated with or motivated
by the presence of intraday traders as well, 
e.g. \citet{petukhina2021rise}, \citet{meshcheryakov2020ethereum},
\citet{alexander2022role}, \citet{zhang2022data} and
\citet{katsiampa2022high}. 

\natp{(delete: We have in view to robustify the results from the main body.)}
The methodology in this supplementary material is similar to the main
body, except we 
\begin{enumerate}
\item form two hedging portfolios, BTC-BTCF and ETH-BTCF,
\item simulate trades using Deribit hourly data, and
\item rebalance every four hours.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Data}
The intraday analysis is built upon a dataset of date range from
2020-06-01 00:00 UTC to 2020-08-01 00:00 UTC. 
All the price data are sampled hourly.
The Deribit contract \natp{BTC-25SEP20 (was: 20BTCUSD25SEP20)} represents the BTCF;
the Deribit BTC and ETH index represent the spot of BTC and ETH, respectively.
We take the hourly closing mid-price of the BTCUSD25SEP20 as the futures price and the last value of the BTC and ETH index in every hourly bucket as the spot prices.
Since the date range of the data is fully covered by the lifetime of BTCUSD25SEP20, this study does not require rolling procedure to roll over futures contract near expiry.

\subsubsection{Procedure}
Starting from oldest data:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Calibrate a copula by a training data of 336 datapoints, equivalent to 14 days data
    \item Draw samples $(\tilde r_s, \tilde r_f)$ from the calibrated copula
    \item Numerically search for $h^* = \arg \max \phi(\tilde r_s - h\tilde r_f)$ according to a risk measure $\phi$
    \item Apply $h^*$ to testing data to yield $r_h$; the testing data is the consecutive 4 data points to training data, i.e. the 4 hours data consecutive to the last training data
    \item Repeat the procedure for the next 4 datapoints
    \item Concatenate $r_h$s the and sort chronologically to form a full length out-of-sample hedging portfolio returns
\end{enumerate}

The procedure is further repeated for all the combinations of risk measures and copulae.
The full-length out-of-sample returns represent the corresponding performance of a particular risk measure-copula combination.
They are used in computation mean square error (MSE) and lower-semi-variance (LSV) shown in the following section.

The AIC selection step is performed between Steps 1 and 2 of the procedure above.
The resulting out-of-sample returns are a mix of results from the copula that has the lowest AIC on the training data.
We keep a record of how many times a copula is choosen by this step.
To yield robust HE measures, we apply stationary bootstrapping to the
full-length AIC selected out-of-sample returns with the following
parameters: $p=1/4, T=300, N=1000$. 

\subsection{Results}
\begin{figure}[t]
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{_pics/hourly_HE.png}
  \caption{Intraday HEs of BTC-BTCF and ETH-BTCF portfolio. The HEs of BTC-BTCF portfolios are significantly higher than $0$,
which suggests involving the BTCF in the portfolio can effectively reduce market risk.
The HEs of ETH-BTCF portfolios are lower than that of BTC-BTCF portfolios, and sometimes go below $0$.
We nullify the hedging ability of BTCF in this intraday ETH-BTCF setting.
  \href{http://www.quantlet.com/}{\includegraphics[height=\baselineskip]{_pics/qletlogo_tr.png}} }
\label{fig:HEboxplot_intraday}
\end{figure}

\textit{Bootstrapped out-of-sample HEs}: The analysis begins with the
boxplot in figure \ref{fig:HEboxplot_intraday} of the bootstrapped out-of-sample
HEs. 
In general, most of the daily rebalancing results of BTC-BTCF carry over to the intraday rebalancing schedule;
\natp{\em [This can be {\bf significantly} shortened!]} The intraday rebalancing ETH-BTCF is different from its daily rebalancing counterpart.
Note that the exact values of HEs from the two rebalancing schedules should not be directly compared for two reasons: 1. The data are from different date ranges; 2. Various factors contribute to the difference between results from different sampling frequencies, e.g. Epps effect, microstructure noise,
and asynchronous trading.
However, we compare the patterns and conclusions to get a general understanding of the hedging issue for future use.

The main difference between the intraday rebalancing and daily
rebalancing ETH-BTCF portfolio is that negative HEs appear in the
intraday results in all the risk measures we consider. \natp{This
  implies that hedgers cannot draw on potential intraday dependence
  between BTC and ETH to hedge an ETH crypto position. (delete: 
The negative HEs suggests that BTCF should not be used to hedge against ETH in an intraday setting.
Consider also the fact that BTCF is written on BTC instead of ETH, hedgers have no ground to assume they can take advantage of the intraday dependency structure between ETH and BTCF for hedging.
Therefore, we mainly focus on the BTC-BTCF portfolios and mentioning
the results of the ETH-BTCF portfolio is needed.)} 


\natp{Turning to BTC-BTCF, among the (delete: \textit{BTC-BTCF HEs}: The HEs of BTC-BTCF are
significantly higher than zero across different risk measures,
suggesting that adding BTCF to a BTC portfolio can effectively reduce
the risk measured by selected measures. Among)} 
risk measures, HE of variance is the highest \natp{(delete: for the
  BTC-BTCF portfolio)}, ranging between 72\% to 98\%, while the
  HE's other risk measures range between 25\% to 80\%.
The finding that reducing variance is a well-achievable objective is
consisten with the findings of the daily rebalancing schedule.
\natp{\em [We can consider deleting the discussion about 99\% risk measures...]}
On the other hand, the HEs of ES99\% and VaR99\% are relatively more dispersed and skewed to the left.
Both risk measures consider only 1\% of the data from the left for deciding the hedge ratio and computing the HEs.
Considering only a few data points naturally leads to a less reliable hedge ratio and lower consistency HEs.
Evidence also shows that ES99\% VaR99\% minimising portfolios have higher MSE and LSV.
This result is again consistent with the daily rebalancing setting.

Figures \ref{fig:BTC_MSE} and \ref{fig:BTC_LSV} report the
out-of-sample MSE and LSV of the BTC-BTCF when different copulae and
risk measures are in use. The MSE and LSV are in a similar magnitude
\natp{\em [than what?]} with a few exceptions, a similar pattern to the daily rebalancing
setting. \natp{\em [Fix sentence.]}

Across various copulae, the BTC-BTCF portfolio that minimises VaR95\%
provides the lowest MSE and LSV. 
Portfolios that minimise variance and ERM with $k=10$ result in similar
magnitudes of MSEs and LSVs \natp{\em [than what?]}, which are
slightly greater than VaR95\%, especially when Gumbel and NIG copulae
are in use to model the dependence. ES99\% generates the highest MSEs
and LSVs, regardless of the copula. \natp{(delete: Notice that the
  portfolios that 
minimise ES99\% and VaR99\% are generally riskier than their 95\%
counterparts in terms of MSEs and LSVs.)}

Across various risk measures, Gumbel and NIG copulae perform
well in the resulting portfolios’ MSE and LSV, except for
ES99\%. 
The Frank copula performs worst, regardless of the risk measure. 
These results are consistent with the daily rebalancing setting and
results in other literature. \natp{\em [Other literature? Perhaps
  better to delete this. Or be more specific.]}
As Gumbel and NIG are the only copulae that can model upper
tail dependence, this suggests that the upper tail dependence is an
essential feature of the dependence structure for hedging.
\natp{\em [Delete?]} The conclusion is further supported by comparing the Gumbel and the
rotated Gumbel copula. 
The rotated Gumbel copula is the 180-degree rotated version of the Gumbel copula, sharing all the features of the Gumbel copula but switching from modelling the lower tail dependence to upper tail dependence.
The rotated Gumbel copula results in portfolios with higher MSEs and
LSVs consistently across risk measures.

 \caption{Intraday copula selection results (shortened).
        The values are the percentage counts of a copula chosen by the AIC procedure during the out-of-sample period.

Table \ref{tab:copulasection_intraday} shows the relative frequencies
of the best fitting copula according to AIC.

\natp{\em [No need to repeat all the numbers in the text, as they are
  given in the table. Draw conclusions directly and mention only
  exceptional numbers.]}
They are $t$-, Plackett, Gaussian Mix Independent, rotated Gumbel and NIG.
Similar to the result in the daily rebalancing schedule, most of the time, 60\% in this case,
the AIC procedure chooses t-Copula to model the dependence structure of BTC-BTCF in the intraday setting.
For the rest of the time, the NIG copula is mainly chosen, accounting for around 26\% of the time.
Rotated Gumbel, Gaussian Mix Independent, and Plackett are spontaneously chosen.
On the other hand, the intraday ETH-BTCF’s AIC selection result is very different from that of the daily rebalancing.
There are three copulae: $t$-, Gaussian Mix Independent, and NIG copula, that are closely chosen, instead of a single copula, rotated Gumbel copula, dominating the list in the daily rebalancing setting.
In the intraday setting, the three copulae are chosen 35.1\%, 24.9\%, and 24.3\% of the time, respectively.
