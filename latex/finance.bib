  abstract     = {In a series of earlier papers, we discussed single name calibration
	for a class of credit barrier models. This article continues along
	that line to include correlation modeling and applications to credit
	baskets and CDOs. We build high dimensional lattice models correlated
	by means of conditional independence, whereby the driving factor
	has an economic cycle interpretation. Since the model is rating-based,
	management constraints for cash-flow CDOs can possibly be taken into
	account. Recovery rates are stochastic and the explicit time dependence
	of model parameters is fairly minimal. Our solution method is based
	on spectral methods which are very precise especially regarding the
	calculation of hedge ratios, while numerically noisy Monte Carlo
	simulations are entirely avoided. To illustrate the model in two
	different correlation regimes, we show calibration examples to the
	January and May 2005 data for CDX tranches, with and without management
	constraints. In both situations, we find that the market price of
	correlation risk can be estimated in such a way to achieve a perfect
	match to CDO tranche spreads while staying consistent with all single
	name CDS curves.},

	In other papers, both Merton [8] and Ross [11][REF] noted the broad
	applicability of option pricing arguments. At the same time Black
	and Scholes also pointed out that actual security indentures have
	a variety of conditions that would bring new features and complications
	into the valuation process.
	
	
	Our objective in this paper is to make some general statements on
	this valuation process and then turn to an analysis of certain types
	of bond indenture provisions which are often found in practice. Specifically,
	we will look at the effects of safety covenants, subordination arrangements,
	and restrictions on the financing of interest and dividend payments.},

  abstract = {{The second edition of this book is unique in that it focuses on methods
	for making formal statistical inference from all the models in an
	a priori set (Multi-Model Inference). A philosophy is presented for
	model-based data analysis and a general strategy outlined for the
	analysis of empirical data. The book invites increased attention
	on a priori science hypotheses and modeling. Kullback-Leibler Information
	represents a fundamental quantity in science and is Hirotugu Akaike's
	basis for model selection. The maximized log-likelihood function
	can be bias-corrected as an estimator of expected, relative Kullback-Leibler
	information. This leads to Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) and
	various extensions. These methods are relatively simple and easy
	to use in practice, but based on deep statistical theory. The information
	theoretic approaches provide a unified and rigorous theory, an extension
	of likelihood theory, an important application of information theory,
	and are objective and practical to employ across a very wide class
	of empirical problems. The book presents several new ways to incorporate
	model selection uncertainty into parameter estimates and estimates
	of precision. An array of challenging examples is given to illustrate
	various technical issues. This is an applied book written primarily
	for biologists and statisticians wanting to make inferences from
	multiple models and is suitable as a graduate text or as a reference
	for professional analysts.}},

	the static hedge works well under both continuous and discontinuous
	price dynamics. Simulation exercises show that under purely continuous
	price dynamics, discretized static hedges with as few as three to
	five options perform similarly to the dynamic delta hedge with the
	underlying futures and daily updating, but the static hedges strongly
	outperform the daily delta hedge when the underlying price process
	contains random jumps. A historical analysis using over 13 years
	of data on S&P 500 index options further validates the superior performance
	of the static hedging strategy in practical situations.},

	When examining market prices for dierent tranches of Collateralised

	for each tranche, forming
	
	a smile. We explain this phenomenon using a single credit event structural

	is able to explain correlation

	in the case of
	
	independent marginal distributions (Deheuvels, 1979, 1981). Van der
	Vaart and Wellner
	
	(1996) utilize the functional delta-method to show convergence in
	`1([a; b]2) for some
	
	0 < a < b < 1, under restrictions on the distribution functions. We
	extend their results
	
	by proving the weak convergence of this process in `1([0; 1]2) under
	minimal conditions
	
	on the copula function, which coincides with the result earlier obtained
	by Gaenssler
	
	and Stute (1987). It is argued that the condition on the copula function
	is necessary.
	
	The proof uses the functional delta-method and as a consequence, the
	convergence of the
	
	bootstrap counterpart of the empirical copula process follows immediately.
	In addition,
	
	weak convergence of the smoothed empirical copula process is established,
	which has not
	
	been studied so far.},

	defaults when the value of its assets hits a certain barrier. In
	2001 Zhou showed how the model can be extended to two obligors whose
	assets are correlated. In this paper we show how the model can be
	extended to a large number of different obligors. The correlations
	between the assets of the obligors are determined by one or more
	factors. We examine the dynamics of credit spreads implied by the
	model and explore how the model prices tranches of collateralized
	debt obligations (CDOs). We compare the model with the widely used
	Gaussian copula model of survival time and test how well the model
	fits market data on the prices of CDO tranches. We consider two extensions
	of the model. The first reflects empirical research showing that
	default correlations are positively dependent on default rates. The
	second reflects empirical research showing that recovery rates are
	negatively dependent on default rates.},

	feature of the approach is the use of market prices for a set of
	bonds from the same issuer to obtain a term structure of risk-neutral
	implied default probabilities. This article extends the model significantly
	to allow for the existence of multiple correlated default risks.
	Correlations are important either when the swap is subject to counterparty
	credit risk, or when there are multiple underlyings with correlated
	risks, as in a basket default swap.},

  abstract = {Capital allocation techniques are of central importance in portfolio
	management and risk-based performance measurement. In this paper
	we propose an axiom system for capital allocation and analyze its
	satisfiability and completeness: it is shown that for a given risk
	measure rho there exists a capital allocation Lambdarho that satisfies
	the main axioms if and only if rho is subadditive and positively
	homogeneous. Furthermore, it is proved that the axiom system uniquely
	specifies Lambdarho . We apply the axiomatization to the most popular
	risk measures in the finance industry in order to derive explicit
	capital allocation formulae for these measures.},

  abstract = {This article examines the optimal capital structure of a firm that
	can choose both the amount and maturity of its debt. Bankruptcy is
	determined endogenously rather than by the imposition of a positive
	net worth condition or by a cash flow constraint. The results extend
	Leland's (1994a) closed-form results to a much richer class of possible
	debt structures and permit study of the optimal maturity of debt
	as well as the optimal amount of debt. The model predicts leverage,
	credit spreads, default rates, and writedowns, which accord quite
	closely with historical averages. While short term debt does not
	exploit tax benefits as completely as long term debt, it is more
	likely to provide incentive compatibility between debt holders and
	equity holders. Short term debt reduces or eliminates "asset substitution"
	agency costs. The tax advantage of debt must be balanced against
	bankruptcy and agency costs in determining the optimal maturity of
	the capital structure. The model predicts differently shaped term
	structures of credit spreads for different level of risk. These term
	structures are similar to those found empirically by Sarig and Warga
	(1989). Our results have important implications for bond portfolio
	management. In general, Macaulay duration dramatically overstates
	true duration of risky debt, which may be negative for "junk" bonds.
	Furthermore, the "convexity" of bond prices can become "concavity."},

	(MBSs) and exotic options, to be calculated considerably faster than
	is possible by using conventional Monte Carlo methods. In our experiments,
	we examine classical classes of low-discrepancy sequences, such as
	Halton, Sobol', and Faure sequences, as well as the very recent class
	called generalized Niederreiter sequences, in the light of the actual
	convergence rate of numerical integration with practical numbers
	of dimensions. Our results show that for the problems of pricing
	financial derivatives that we tested: (1) generalized Niederreiter
	sequences perform markedly better than both classical sequences and
	Monte Carlo methods; and (2) classical low-discrepancy sequences
	often perform worse than Monte Carlo methods. Finally, we discuss
	several important research issues from both practical and theoretical
	viewpoints.},

	indispensable, given explosive development of the credit derivatives
	market, scarce capital resources, and the rules of regulatory authorities
	concerning credit risk. Increasing securitization of credit risk
	via collateralized debt obligations and the growing popularity of
	multi-credit derivatives like basket default swaps calls not just
	for modeling default but also for modeling the dependence across
	defaults of different obligors. Structural models, also called threshold
	models, are appealing because of their simplicity and the linking
	of the credit event to the firm's economic fundamentals. Structural
	models are relatively straightforward to extend to multiple credits
	with correlated defaults, although calibration to a given term structure
	of default probabilities is often not possible or computationally
	demanding. Reduced-form models follow a completely different approach.
	Dependencies between defaults for multicredit products are often
	modeled using copulas.},

  abstract = {This paper is on developing stochastic analysis simultaneously under
	a general family of probability measures that are not dominated by
	a single probability measure. The interest in this question originates
	from the probabilistic representations of fully nonlinear partial
	differential equations and applications to mathematical finance.
	The existing literature relies either on the capacity theory (Denis
	and Martini), or on the underlying nonlinear partial differential
	equation (Peng). In both approaches, the resulting theory requires
	certain smoothness, the so-called quasi-sure continuity, of the corresponding
	processes and random variables in terms of the underlying canonical
	process. In this paper, we investigate this question for a larger
	class of ``non-smooth" processes, but with a restricted family of
	non-dominated probability measures. For smooth processes, our approach
	leads to similar results as in previous literature, provided the
	restricted family satisfies an additional density property.},

	a novel approach to quoting correlations for synthetic CDO tranches

	Using a simple intensity-based credit risk model, we generate "true"
	tranche spreads and examine the behavior of the base correlations
	and the merits of the relative valuation approach. We reach three
	conclusions. First, even if the true default correlation increases,
	base correlations for some tranches may actually decrease. Second,
	base correlations can vary, depending only on the p ...},

The sample covariance matrix and single-index covariance matrix. This method is generally known as shrinkage, and it is standard in decision theory and in empirical Bayesian statistics. Our shrinkage estimator can be seen as a way to account for extra-market covariance without havingo to specify an arbitrary multi-factor structure. For NYSE and AMEX stock returns from 1972 to 1995, it can be used to select portfolios with significantly lower out-of-sample variance than a set of existing estimators, including multifactor models.

  abstract = {Financial correlations play a central role in financial theory and also in many practical applications. From theoretical point of view, the key interest is in a proper description of the structure and dynamics of correlations. From practical point of view, the emphasis is on the ability of the developed models to provide the adequate input for the numerous portfolio and risk management procedures used in the financial industry. This is crucial, since it has been long argued that correlation matrices determined from financial series contain a relatively large amount of noise and, in addition, most of the portfolio and risk management techniques used in practice can be quite sensitive to the inputs. In this paper we introduce a model (simulation)-based approach which can be used for a systematic investigation of the effect of the different sources of noise in financial correlations in the portfolio and risk management context. To illustrate the usefulness of this framework, we develop several toy models for the structure of correlations and, by considering the finiteness of the time series as the only source of noise, we compare the performance of several correlation matrix estimators introduced in the academic literature and which have since gained also a wide practical use. Based on this experience, we believe that our simulation-based approach can also be useful for the systematic investigation of several other problems of much interest in finance.},

  abstract = {According to recent findings [1, 2], empirical covariance matrices deduced from financial return series contain such a high amount of noise that, apart from a few large eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenvectors, their structure can essentially be regarded as random. In [1], e.g., it is reported that about 94% of the spectrum of these matrices can be fitted by that of a random matrix drawn from an appropriately chosen ensemble. In view of the fundamental role of covariance matrices in the theory of portfolio optimization as well as in industry-wide risk management practices, we analyze the possible implications of this effect. Simulation experiments with matrices having a structure such as described in [1, 2] lead us to the conclusion that in the context of the classical portfolio problem (minimizing the portfolio variance under linear constraints) noise has relatively little effect. To leading order the solutions are determined by the stable, large eigenvalues, and the displacement of the solution (mea- sured in variance) due to noise is rather small: depending on the size of the portfolio and on the length of the time series, it is of the order of 5 to 15%. The picture is completely different, however, if we attempt to minimize the variance under non-linear constraints, like those that arise e.g. in the problem of margin accounts or in international capital adequacy regulation. In these problems the presence of noise leads to a serious instability and a high degree of degeneracy of the solutions.},

  abstract = {Recent studies inspired by results from random matrix theory [1, 2, 3] found that covariance matrices determined from empirical financial time series ap- pear to contain such a high amount of noise that their structure can essentially be regarded as random. This seems, however, to be in contradiction with the fundamental role played by covariance matrices in finance, which constitute the pillars of modern investment theory and have also gained industry-wide applications in risk management. Our paper is an attempt to resolve this em- barrassing paradox. The key observation is that the effect of noise strongly depends on the ratio r = n/T, where n is the size of the portfolio and T the length of the available time series. On the basis of numerical experiments and analytic results for some toy portfolio models we show that for relatively large values of r (e.g. 0.6) noise does, indeed, have the pronounced effect suggested by [1, 2, 3] and illustrated later by [4, 5] in a portfolio optimization context, while for smaller r (around 0.2 or below), the error due to noise drops to ac- ceptable levels. Since the length of available time series is for obvious reasons limited in any practical application, any bound imposed on the noise-induced error translates into a bound on the size of the portfolio. In a related set of experiments we find that the effect of noise depends also on whether the problem arises in asset allocation or in a risk measurement context: if covari- ance matrices are used simply for measuring the risk of portfolios with a fixed composition rather than as inputs to optimization, the effect of noise on the measured risk may become very small.},

Bayesian predictive distributions are straightforward to calculate and summarize the investor's future views for return distribution and expected utility computation. Nonlinear functionals, such as market efficiency measures and Sharpe ratios, are easily dealt with from a Bayesian perspective. A central theme in this chapter is the use of simulation-based estimation and prediction via Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and particle filtering (PF) algorithms.

Based on parameters calibrated to the US equity market, our analytical results and simulations show that the estimation window needed for the sample-based mean-variance strategy and its extensions to outperform the 1/N benchmark is around 3000 months for a portfolio with 25 assets and about 6000 months for a portfolio with 50 assets.

We propose using Lasso-type estimators to reduce the dimensionality to a manageable one and provide strong theoret- ical performance guarantees on the forecast capability of our procedure. To be precise, we show that we can forecast future realized covariance matrices almost as precisely as if we had known the true driving dynamics of these in advance. We next investigate the sources of these driving dynamics for the realized covariance matrices of the 30 Dow Jones stocks and find that these dynamics are not stable as the data is aggregated from the daily to the weekly and monthly frequency.
The theoretical performance guarantees on our forecasts are illustrated on the Dow Jones index. In particular, we can beat our benchmark by a wide margin at the longer forecast horizons. Finally, we investigate the economic value of our forecasts in a portfolio selection exercise and find that in certain cases an investor is willing to pay a considerable amount in order get access to our forecasts.

  abstract  = {This article proposes a consistent and efficient estimator of the high-frequency covariance (quadratic covariation) of two arbitrary assets, observed asynchronously with market microstructure noise. This estimator is built on the marriage of the quasi-maximum likelihood estimator of the quadratic variation and the proposed generalized synchronization scheme and thus is not influenced by the Epps effect. Moreover, the estimation procedure is free of tuning parameters or bandwidths and is readily implementable. Monte Carlo simulations show the advantage of this estimator by comparing it with a variety of estimators with specific synchronization methods. The empirical studies of six foreign exchange future contracts illustrate the time-varying correlations of the currencies during the 2008 global financial crisis, demonstrating the similarities and differences in their roles as key currencies in the global market.

  year     = {1998},

  abstract = {Many practical problems in modern finance require an under- standing of the volatility and correlations of asset returns. Ex- amples of such everyday problems include managing the risk of a multi-currency portfolio, optimal asset allocation, and derivatives pricing.
Unfortunately for practitioners, volatility and correlation (or the covariance matrix) cannot be directly observed, and must be es- timated from data on daily returns. Thus, how the covariance matrix is estimated can have important implications for the practice of modern finance. We provide examples to illustrate how many practical decisions are influenced by the covariance matrix choice.
Since the covariance matrix must be estimated, the practitioner faces an interesting trade-off between using estimation methods that most closely resemble real-world phenomena and using es- timation methods that are not computationally burdensome. This trade-off is intensified for larger covariance matrices, which stand at the core of many risk management and asset allocation problems.
In this paper, we discuss the covariance matrix estimation meth- ods used at Goldman Sachs for large-scale risk management and asset allocation problems. We describe how the methods used at Goldman Sachs account for several regularities commonly ob- served in financial data. In this context, we show how these methods offer an improvement on the assumption that returns are generated by a stable Normal distribution. We also contrast the methods used at Goldman Sachs with other commonly used approaches.
Covariance matrix estimation can easily be regarded as a topic that will never be closed. In that spirit, we also offer several sug- gestions for future research, on the premise that a deeper under- standing of the covariance matrix can lead to improved practical decision making.},

  abstract     = {This overview paper reviews covariance estimation problems and re- lated issues arising in the context of portfolio optimization. Given several assets, a portfolio optimizer seeks to allocate a fixed amount of capital among these assets so as to optimize some cost function. For example, the classical Markowitz portfolio optimization frame- work defines portfolio risk as the variance of the portfolio return, and seeks an allocation which minimizes the risk subject to a target expected return. If the mean return vector and the return covariance matrix for the underlying assets are known, the Markowitz problem has a closed-form solution.
In practice, however, the expected returns and the covariance matrix of the returns are unknown and are therefore estimated from historical data. This introduces several problems which render the Markowitz theory impracticable in real portfolio management applications. This paper discusses these problems and reviews some of the existing literature on methods for addressing them.},

We propose a simple but effective visualisation tool to assess bias across a wide range of portfolios. We employ a portfolio perspective to determine covariance matrix loss functions particularly suitable for market risk management. Proper regularisation of the covariance matrix estimate significantly improves performance. These methods are applied to credit default swaps, for which covariance matrices are used to set portfolio margin requirements for central clearing. Among the methods we test, the graphical lasso estimator performs particularly well. The graphical lasso and a hierarchical clustering estimator also yield economically meaningful representations of market structure through a graphical model and a hierarchy, respectively.

For each method, the construction of covariance matrices is given. The relationships among these methods are discussed.},

Second, the increasing im portance of industry factors relative to country factors was a short-lived phenomenon. Third, large growth stocks are more correlated across countries than are small value stocks, and the difference has increased over time},
