\footnotesize{
The introduction of derivatives on Bitcoin, in particular the launch of futures contracts on CME in December 2017 and introduction of cryptocurrency index (CRIX) \citep{trimborn2018crix},
enables investors to hedge risk exposures of Bitcoin by futures or a cryptocurrency index.
We investigate methods of finding the optimal hedge ratio $h^*$ under different dependence structures modeled by copulae and optimality definition described by a range of risk measures.
Because of volatility swings and jumps in Bitcoin prices, the traditional variance-based approach to obtain the hedge ratios is infeasible.
The approach is therefore generalised  to various risk measures, such as Value-at-Risk, Expected Shortfall and Spectral Risk Measures,
and to different copulae for capturing the dependency between spot and future returns, such as the Gaussian, Student-$t$,
NIG and Archimedean copulae. Various measures of hedge effectiveness in out-of-sample tests give insights in the practice of hedging Bitcoin and the CRIX,
a cryptocurrency index.\\

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}

Cryptocurrencies (CCs) are a growing asset class.
Many more CCs are now available on the market since the first
cryptocurrency Bitcoin (BTC) surfaced, Nakemoto (2009). %\natp{\em [BTC was introduced in 2009.]}
As the network effect weighs in, the prices of bitcoin and its variants have risen in tandem. These innovations and the perceived investment potential have led to rapid growth in the number of altcoins and the market size of CC. The price of bitcoin even surged to USD 20,000 at beginning of 2021. 
Bitcoin is popular with the techno tribe, the currency is regarded as being beyond the reach of government regulation- the anonymous founder of Bitcoin introduced the idea of a distributed block chain to prevent the counterfeiting of Bitcoin \citep{oet2015evaluating}.
In response to the rapid development of the CC market, the CME group launched a BTC future contract in Dec 2017. Trading volume in BTC futures surpassed \$2 trillion in 2020 (CryptoCompare, 2020).
While more and more investors (individuals and institution) are adding
CCs and their derivatives into their portfolios. %\natp{portfolios (was: portfolii)}
we see the need to understand the downside risk and find a suitable way to hedge and are interested in resisting extreme risks and improve their profits.
This paper analyse modern techniques for the choice of the hedge ratio of the CC portfolios with various copulae and risk measures. \medskip

Optimal hedge ratio is the appropriate size of futures contracts which should be held such that the movements in future price cancel that of BTC.
The task of determining an optimal hedge ratio is not easy.
It relies on the dependence between the BTC price and future price.
%In this paper, we investigate the performance of different copulae and
%risk measures in hedging Bitcoin and CRIX with Bitcoin
%futures. {\color{blue} only this portfolio?} \natp{\em [$\leftarrow$ Make this the first sentence of the paper!]}
Copulae provide the flexibility to model multivariate random variable
separately by its margins and dependence structure.
The concept of copulae was originated by Wassily Hoeffding \citep{hoeffding2012collected} and, despite the slight difference, popularised by the work of Abe Sklar \citep{Sklar1959}.
Different risk measures account for investors' risk attitude.
They serve as loss functions in the searching process of optimal hedge ratio.
Vast literature discussed the relationship between risk measures and investor's risk attitude, we refer readers to
\citet{artzner1999coherent} for an axiomatic, economic reasoning approach of risk measure construction;
\citet{embrechts2002correlation} for reasoning of using Expected Shortfall (ES) and Spectral Risk Measure (SRM) in addition to VaR;
\citet{Acerbi2002} for direct linkage between risk measures and investor's risk attitude using the concept of "risk aversion function". \medskip

Financial asset return is known to be non Gaussian \citep{fama1963mandelbrot}.
In particular, Gaussian models cannot produce so-called fat tails and asymmetry of observed probability densities,
which leads to underestimate financial risks.
%\natp{\cite{Cont2001}}. \natp{\em [non-Gaussian is not
  %very specific, a uniform r.v.\ is also non-Gaussian. Try to express
 % this in a more meaningful way, e.g.\ Financial data are known to
  %exhibit more extreme events than a normal distribution can capture.]}
Therefore, one cannot solely rely on $2^\text{nd}$ order moment calculations in order to
minimize downside risk. Variance as a risk measure doesn't consider the variety of investors' utility functions. However, the investors are tail-risk averse.
\citet{bollerslev2015tail} find that the jump tail risk is more closely associated with changes in risk-aversion.
It is important to link the investor utility's functions as hedging the tail risk.
Significant tail risks lead to the need to investigate even static hedge with more refined methods than minimum-variance based \citep{ederington2008minimum}. \medskip
%One may turn to VaR to monitor tail risk. Hence, the VaR as a sole risk measure has two disadvantages.
%First, it reflects only tail probability and not tail loss, and next it is not coherent;

In order to capture the risk preferences of investors, in addition to variance, we include other risk measures.
We consider also Value-at-Risk (VaR), Expected Shortfall (ES), and Spectral Risk Measure (SRM).
%Coherency is a very natural property that suggest diversification will reduce risk.
VaR is widely used by the industry and easy to understand.
ES and SRM are chosen because of their coherence property, in particular, they encourage diversification.
SRM is also directly related to individual's utility function.
Popular examples are the exponential SRM and power SRM introduced by
\citet{dowd2008spectral}.\medskip
%\natp{\em [Careful with wording! The
 %hedge is not optimal. The optimal hedge ratio that minimises a risk measure is chosen.]}
%In particular, the SRM proposed by \citet{Acerbi2002} accounts for investors' utility (i.e. risk preference).
%SRM is a weighted average of the quantities of a loss distribution, the weights of which depend on the investor's risk-aversion. In other words, 

% \natp{\em [This needs not go in the introduction. Just briefly mention the risk measures, and possibly that ES and SRM are chosen because of their coherence.]}
%\medskip

%\natp{The introduction should go along the lines:
%  \begin{itemize}
%  \item 1-2 sentence: Which problem is solved in this paper?
%  \item Background Bitcoin: Growth, but roller-coaster ride, institutional investment,
%    exchange-traded futures (the exchange is important!) (5 sentences,
%    with references!)
%  \item Significant tail risks and basis risk lead to the need to
%    investigate even static hedges (=futures) with more refined
%    methods than minimum-variance based (reference to Ederington
%    here; this uses variance as risk measure and correlation as
%    dependence measure).
%  \item To capture empirical properties, extend to other risk measures
%    and dependence models. 
%  \end{itemize}
%  }

This paper considers hedging Bitcoin using its future. % and an aggregated index of cryptocurrencies CRIX,
i.e. to find an optimal hedge ratio $h^*$ such that the risk of a hedged portfolio $r^h = r^S - h^*r^F$ has
minimal risk.
Here $r^S$ as the log return of BTC spot price, $r^F$ the log return of Bitcoin future.
The leptokurtic properties mentioned above leads us to deploy a comprehensive way of modelling dependency namely copulae together with various risk measures as loss function to find optimal hedge ratio.
In this paper, we first calibrate the log returns of BTC and CME future by copulae,
then find the optimal quantity of assets in the hedged portfolio according to a range of risk measures.
%By Sklar's theorem, we can model the margin and the dependence structure separately using copulae.
%This gives us enormous flexibility to model financial data.
\citet{barbi2014copula} use the C-convolution operator introduced by \citet{cherubini2011copula} to derive the distribution
of linear combination of margins with copula as their dependence structure.
Our main result shows that the distribution function of a linear combination of random variables can be expressed via the copula and margins. \medskip
%We propose a corrected expression the \citet{barbi2014copula}'s equation and propose a general expression for the density of the linear combination.
 %\natp{\em [No need to mention in the introduction that
 % the version is corrected. The main result -- that the distribution
 % function of a linear combination of random variables can be
  %expressed via the copula and margins -- remains valid.]}\medskip
%Another advantage of copulae is that they \natp{capture (was: describe)} the whole dependence structure of random variables.
%Figure \ref{fig:density illustration} illustrate the samples drawn
%from different copulae but with the same Spearman's $\rho$. \natp{\em
%  [Move this out of introduction.]}
%
%The distribution of the linear combination of margins $Z$ is also affected by the copulae.
%One can see the $Z$ of Gumbel and Clayton copula are skewed to the right and left respectively due to the
%asymmetry (radial symmetry \citet{Nelsen1999}) of copula.\natp{\em
%  [Move this out of the introduction.]}

%Even though they reveal that SRM have some properties which cause problems when applying to practical risk management,
%they show that exponential utility function might be plausible in some circumstances under weak conditions \citealp{buhlmann1980economic}.

%However, it still causes some problems to capture the behaviors of investors when the value of absolute risk aversion (ARA) parameter beyond a threshold \citealp{markowitz2014mean}.
%If the relative risk aversion coefficients (RRA) are less than 1, \citet{dowd2008spectral} address that the weighting of lower risk-averse is higher than the higher risk-averse as the loss of portfolio increases.
%On the other hand, the power SRM proposed by \citet{dowd2008spectral} when the relative risk aversion coefficients (RRA) are larger than 1, has also proper features to give a higher weight as loss increase.
%Note that the selection of the utility function and the value of risk aversion parameter would be the matters of solving specific financial problem.
%By contrast, the estimation of the VaR and the ES are conditional on the confidence level which is not easy to determine.
%Since SRM is capable of reflecting the investor's attitude toward risk and has been applied to various fields of financial decision making, this paper apply to the determination of the optimal hedge ratio.
%It is important for the hedger who should choose a proper value for the hedge ratio in order to minimize the risk of portfolio.\\
%
%A joint distribution of spot and futures has been specified in terms of a copula function to embody the tail behaviors of the spot and the futures \citealp{barbi2014copula}.
%Copulae enable us to build the flexible multivariate distributions of dependence structure.
%This paper conducts four types of copulae (Gaussian, t, Frank, Clayton, and Normal Inverse Gaussian) to derive the copula representation of quantities to reach copula-based SRM of the hedged portfolio.
%It should be noted that the Clayton copula can be also used to construct the joint distribution with right tail dependence. Frank copula is symmetric and appropriate for data that exhibit weak or no tail dependence. Normal Inverse Gaussian (NIG) copula is a flexible system of joint distribution that includes fat-tailed and skewed distributions. However, there is still no evidence yet for selecting an exclusive copula in applications of hedging.\\
%
%An optimal hedge ratio represents the investor's subjective marginal rate of substitution between risk and return. \citet{cecchetti1988estimation} found that the optimal hedge ratios increases when an investor with a greater risk aversion by maximizing the expected value of the logarithm of wealth.
%It is understandable if a investor's attitude is more risk-averse, they will increase the position of futures contracts to hedging the uncertain risk which they may take in the future.
%On the contrary, \citet{brandtner2015decision} address that the theoretical result predictions for the subset of exponential and power SRMs are not reasonable but may be counter-intuitive if the corresponding parameter of risk aversion is large enough.
%Different from \citet{brandtner2015decision}, we consider the joint distribution of financial assets to choose the optimal hedge ratio by minimizing SRM.
%However, the empirical result shows the direction of optimal hedge ratio is increasing as the parameters represents the investors' attitude increases. \\

%This paper has two main contributions to the existing literature. First, we reveal the quantiles of loss function built by different copulae. Second, by minimizing exponential SRM (ESRM) to determine the optimal hedge ratio, we give a guidance on the choice of risk aversion function to assist the risk manager in choosing an optimal risk aversion function for a portfolio. To our knowledge, these have received no attention so far in the published literatures.\\

This research proposes the model techniques for the analysis of the hedging strategy on the CC's tail risk in five aspects.
The remainder of the article is organized as follows. Section 2 methodology. Section 3 data, and Section 4 empirical result. Section 5 concludes. \medskip
