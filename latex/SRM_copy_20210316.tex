\footnotesize{ We investigate different methods of hedging cryptocurrencies with Bitcoin futures.
The introduction of derivatives on Bitcoin, in particular the launch of futures contracts on CME in December 2017 and introduction of cryptocurrency index (CRIX) \citep{trimborn2018crix},
allows for hedging exposures on Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general.
Because of volatility swings and jumps in Bitcoin prices, the traditional variance-based approach to obtain the hedge ratios is infeasible.
The approach is therefore generalised  to various risk measures, such as value-at-risk, expected shortfall and spectral risk measures,
and to different copulae for capturing the dependency between spot and future returns, such as the Gaussian, Student-$t$,
NIG and Archimedean copulas. Various measures of hedge effectiveness in out-of-sample tests give insights in the practice of hedging Bitcoin and the CRIX index,
a cryptocurrency index.\\

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}

Cryptocurrencies (CCs) are a growing asset class.
Many more CCs are now available on the market since the first cryptocurrency Bitcoin (BTC) was introduced by \citet{nakamoto2019bitcoin}.
In response to the rapid development of the cryptocurrency market, CRIX \citep{trimborn2018crix} is developed to represent the whole
market by an index aggregating the price of important coins in the market.
In Dec 2017, the CME group launched its new bitcoin future contract.
While more and more investors (individuals and institution) are adding CCs and their derivatives into their portfolii,
we see the need to understand the downside risk and find a suitable way to hedge.
We are particularly interested in resisting extreme risks and improve their profits.
In this paper, we investigate the performance of different copulae and risk measures in hedging Bitcoin and CRIX with Bitcoin futures.
Copula provides the flexibility to model multivariate random variable separately by its margins and dependence structure.
Different risk measures accounts for investors' risk attitude.
Vast literature discussed the relationship between risk measures and investor's risk attitude, we refer readers to
\citet{artzner1999coherent} for an axiomatic, economic reasoning approach of risk measure construction;
\citet{embrechts2002correlation} for reasoning of using expected shortfall and spectral risk in addition to VaR;
\citet{Acerbi2002} for direct linkage between risk measures and investor's risk attitude using the concept of "risk aversion function".
Financial data is known to be non Gaussian, let alone the violate cryptocurrencies.
One cannot rely on only 2nd order moment calculations in order to minimize downside risk.
One may turn to VaR to monitor The VaR as a sole risk measure has two disadvantages.
First, it reflects only tail probability and not tail loss, and next it is not coherent;
Coherency is a very natural property that suggest diversification will reduce risk. \medskip

The non Gaussianity and weaknesses of VaR opens a new path of optimizing the hedge ratio by employing spectral risk measures.
In this paper, we calibrate the log returns of Bitcoin, CRIX, and CME future by copulae,
then find the optimal quantity of assets in the hedged portfolio.
By Sklar's theorem, we can model the margin and the dependence structure separately.
This gives us enormous flexibility to model financial data.
\citet{barbi2014copula} use the C-convolution operator introduced by \citet{cherubini2011copula} to derive the distribution
of linear combination of margins with copula as their dependence structure.
We propose a corrected expression the \citet{barbi2014copula}'s equation and propose a general expression for the density of the linear
combination. \medskip

Unlike dependence measures, e.g. correlation, Kendall's tau, and Spearman's rho,
copulae describe the whole dependence structure of random variables.
Figure \ref{fig:density illustration} illustrate the samples drawn from different copulae but with the same Spearman's rho.
The distribution of the linear combination of margins $Z$ is also affected by the copulae.
One can see the $Z$ of Gumbel and Clayton copula are skewed to the right and left respectively due to the
asymmetry (radial symmetry \citet{Nelsen1999}) of copula.
\medskip

  $X, Y \sim N(0,1)$,

  Lower Panel: Scatter plot of samples from copulas.
  This illustration shows how dependence structure modelled by different copulas affects the density of the linear combination
  of margins.
  Notice that the $Z$ modelled by the asymmetric copulas, namely the Clayton and Gumbel copulas, are skewed to right
  and left respectively. \href{http://www.quantlet.com/}{\includegraphics[width=15pt]{_pics/qletlogo_tr.png}}}

The optimality of our hedge is determined by various risk measures, they include variance, expected shortfall (ES), value-at-risk (VaR), and spectral risk measures (SRM).
In particular, the SRM proposed by \citet{acerbi2002spectral} accounts for investors' utility (i.e. risk preference).
SRM is a weighted average of the quantities of a loss distribution, the weights of which depend on the investor's risk-aversion.
In other words, the risk estimation is directly related to the user's utility function.
Popular examples are the exponential SRM and power SRM introduced by \citet{dowd2008spectral}. \medskip
%Even though they reveal that SRM have some properties which cause problems when applying to practical risk management,
%they show that exponential utility function might be plausible in some circumstances under weak conditions \citealp{buhlmann1980economic}.

%However, it still causes some problems to capture the behaviors of investors when the value of absolute risk aversion (ARA) parameter beyond a threshold \citealp{markowitz2014mean}.
%If the relative risk aversion coefficients (RRA) are less than 1, \citet{dowd2008spectral} address that the weighting of lower risk-averse is higher than the higher risk-averse as the loss of portfolio increases.
%On the other hand, the power SRM proposed by \citet{dowd2008spectral} when the relative risk aversion coefficients (RRA) are larger than 1, has also proper features to give a higher weight as loss increase.
%Note that the selection of the utility function and the value of risk aversion parameter would be the matters of solving specific financial problem.
%By contrast, the estimation of the VaR and the ES are conditional on the confidence level which is not easy to determine.
%Since SRM is capable of reflecting the investor's attitude toward risk and has been applied to various fields of financial decision making, this paper apply to the determination of the optimal hedge ratio.
%It is important for the hedger who should choose a proper value for the hedge ratio in order to minimize the risk of portfolio.\\
%
%A joint distribution of spot and futures has been specified in terms of a copula function to embody the tail behaviors of the spot and the futures \citealp{barbi2014copula}.
%Copulae enable us to build the flexible multivariate distributions of dependence structure.
%This paper conducts four types of copulae (Gaussian, t, Frank, Clayton, and Normal Inverse Gaussian) to derive the copula representation of quantities to reach copula-based SRM of the hedged portfolio.
%It should be noted that the Clayton copula can be also used to construct the joint distribution with right tail dependence. Frank copula is symmetric and appropriate for data that exhibit weak or no tail dependence. Normal Inverse Gaussian (NIG) copula is a flexible system of joint distribution that includes fat-tailed and skewed distributions. However, there is still no evidence yet for selecting an exclusive copula in applications of hedging.\\
%
%An optimal hedge ratio represents the investor's subjective marginal rate of substitution between risk and return. \citet{cecchetti1988estimation} found that the optimal hedge ratios increases when an investor with a greater risk aversion by maximizing the expected value of the logarithm of wealth.
%It is understandable if a investor's attitude is more risk-averse, they will increase the position of futures contracts to hedging the uncertain risk which they may take in the future.
%On the contrary, \citet{brandtner2015decision} address that the theoretical result predictions for the subset of exponential and power SRMs are not reasonable but may be counter-intuitive if the corresponding parameter of risk aversion is large enough.
%Different from \citet{brandtner2015decision}, we consider the joint distribution of financial assets to choose the optimal hedge ratio by minimizing SRM.
%However, the empirical result shows the direction of optimal hedge ratio is increasing as the parameters represents the investors' attitude increases. \\

%This paper has two main contributions to the existing literature. First, we reveal the quantiles of loss function built by different copulae. Second, by minimizing exponential SRM (ESRM) to determine the optimal hedge ratio, we give a guidance on the choice of risk aversion function to assist the risk manager in choosing an optimal risk aversion function for a portfolio. To our knowledge, these have received no attention so far in the published literatures.\\
