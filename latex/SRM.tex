\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}
Cryptocurrencies (CCs) are a growing asset class.
Many more CCs are now available on the market since the first
cryptocurrency Bitcoin (BTC) surfaced \citep{nakamoto2009}.
In response to the rapid development of the CC market, the CME Group
launched a\natp{n exchange-traded} BTC futures contract in December
2017. \natp{\em [The 
  terminology is futures contract, not future contract.]}
Trading volume in BTC futures surpassed \$ 2 trillion in 2020
(CryptoCompare, 2020). \natp{\em[CryptoCompare not in references;
  possibly add as footnote (if it's a website, not an academic
  reference).]} \medskip

By April 2021, the market value of outstanding coins had risen to
\natp{\$ 2.3 trillion (was: 2.3t)},
more than 6\% of the world's narrow money supply and almost 3\% of the
world GDP.\natp{\em [Is this open interest in futures? Then a
  comparision with money supply and GDP is tricky. Or is 2.3
  trillion the USD value of mined coins?]}
As more individual and institutional investors are
adding CCs and CC derivatives into their portfolios, this creates
the need to understand downside risks and find suitable ways to
hedge against extreme risks. 
The price of BTC even surged to USD 60,000 in April 2021. \natp{
  add: from USD ... in October 2020. {\em [Also, need consistency re
    USD or \$. At this position the sentence is ``dangling'', i.e., it
    is not connected to the rest of the text. Place it earlier?]}}
\natp{(delete: Investments into CCs therefore require proper
  quantification of the dynamics.)}
\natp{Fom a risk management perspective, the roller-coaster ride
  of crypto prices creates significant basis risk, even when using
  simple hedges involving crypto portfolios and BTC futures. This
  requires analysing the dependence structure of cryptos and
  futures beyond linear correlation.}

\natp{In this paper, we analyse static hedges of crypto portfolios
  with Bitcoin futures. Owing to the asymmetry of crypto returns as
  well as the occurrence of extreme events, we consider different 
  dependence structures via a variety of copula models and we optimise
  the hedge ratio using different risk measures. A similar study was
  conducted by \citep{barbi2014copula} for equity and FX portfolios. 
(was: This paper analyses quantitative techniques for the choice of the
hedge ratio of CC portfolios with various copulae and risk
measures.)} \medskip 
%
%
%\natp{\em [BTC was introduced in 2009.]}
%As the network effect weighs in, the prices of bitcoin and its variants have risen in tandem.
%These innovations and the perceived investment potential have led to rapid growth in the number of altcoins and the market size of CC.
%Bitcoin is popular with the techno tribe, the currency is regarded as being beyond the reach of government regulation- the anonymous founder of Bitcoin introduced the idea of a distributed block chain to prevent the counterfeiting of Bitcoin \citep{oet2015evaluating}.


%and are interested in resisting extreme risks and improve their profits.

The \natp{(delete: optimal)} hedge ratio is the appropriate amount of
futures contracts to be held in order to eliminate risk exposure in
the underlying security. 
\natp{(delete: The task of determining an optimal hedge ratio is not easy.)} \natp{\em
  [Unclear what sentence is supposed to say; very subjective. I
  suggest to delete or reformulate.]}
\natp{The determination of the optimal hedge ratio relies primarily
  (was: 
It relies)} on the dependence between the BTC price and future price.
%In this paper, we investigate the performance of different copulae and
%risk measures in hedging Bitcoin and CRIX with Bitcoin
%futures. {\color{blue} only this portfolio?} \natp{\em [$\leftarrow$ Make this the first sentence of the paper!]}
Copulae provide the flexibility to model multivariate random variables
separately by its margins and dependence structure.
The concept of copulae was originally developed (but not under this
name) by Wassily Hoeffding \citep{hoeffding1940masstabinvariante}
and later popularised by the work of Abe Sklar \citep{Sklar1959}. \medskip 

Different risk measures account for investors' risk attitude.
They serve as loss functions in the searching process of optimal hedge ratio.
Of the vast literature discussed the relationship between risk
measures and investor's risk attitude, we refer readers to
\citet{artzner1999coherent} for an axiomatic, economic reasoning
approach of risk measure construction;
\citet{embrechts2002correlation} for reasoning of using Expected
Shortfall (ES) and Spectral Risk Measures (SRM) in addition to VaR;
\citet{Acerbi2002} for direct linkage between risk measures and
investor's risk attitude using the concept of a ``risk aversion
function''. \medskip 

Financial asset returns have long known to be non-Gaussian, see e.g.\
\citep{fama1963mandelbrot,Cont2001}. Specifically, Gaussian models
cannot produce fat tails and asymmetry of observed
asset returns, implying a consistent underestimation of financial
risks. 
%\natp{\cite{Cont2001}}. \natp{\em [non-Gaussian is not
  %very specific, a uniform r.v.\ is also non-Gaussian. Try to express
 % this in a more meaningful way, e.g.\ Financial data are known to
  %exhibit more extreme events than a normal distribution can capture.]}
Therefore, one cannot solely rely on second-order moment calculations
in order to minimize downside risk. Variance as a risk measure does not
account for the variety of investors' utility functions. In
particular, it is konw that  
investors are tail-risk averse. \natp{\em [Last two sentences are
  ``dangling''. Provide references. ]}
\citet{bollerslev2015tail} find that the jump tail risk is more
closely associated with changes in risk-aversion. \natp{\em
  [Unclear. Do investors constantly change their risk aversion?]}
It is important to link the investor utility's functions as hedging
the tail risk. \natp{\em [Careful. We do not do this in our paper, so
  maybe tone down.]}
Significant tail risks lead to the need to investigate even static
hedges with more refined methods than minimising the variance assuming
normally distributed asset returns
\citep{ederington2008minimum}. \medskip 
%One may turn to VaR to monitor tail risk. Hence, the VaR as a sole risk measure has two disadvantages.
%First, it reflects only tail probability and not tail loss, and next it is not coherent;

In order to capture \natp{a variety of (was: the)} risk
preferences\natp{(delete: of investors)}, in addition to variance, we
include \natp{the risk measures (was: other risk measures. 
We consider also)} value-at-risk (VaR), expected shortfall (ES), and
spectral risk measures (SRM). 
%Coherency is a very natural property that suggest diversification will reduce risk.
VaR is widely used by the finance industry and easy to understand. 
ES and SRM are chosen because of their coherence property, in
particular, they \natp{recognise diversification benefits (was: encourage diversification)}.
SRM can also be directly related to an individual's utility function.
Examples are the exponential SRM and power SRM introduced by
\citet{dowd2008spectral}.\medskip
%\natp{\em [Careful with wording! The
 %hedge is not optimal. The optimal hedge ratio that minimises a risk measure is chosen.]}
%In particular, the SRM proposed by \citet{Acerbi2002} accounts for investors' utility (i.e. risk preference).
%SRM is a weighted average of the quantities of a loss distribution, the weights of which depend on the investor's risk-aversion. In other words, 

% \natp{\em [This needs not go in the introduction. Just briefly mention the risk measures, and possibly that ES and SRM are chosen because of their coherence.]}
%\medskip
%
%\natp{The introduction should go along the lines:
%  \begin{itemize}
%  \item 1-2 sentence: Which problem is solved in this paper?
%  \item Background Bitcoin: Growth, but roller-coaster ride, institutional investment,
%    exchange-traded futures (the exchange is important!) (5 sentences,
%    with references!)
%  \item Significant tail risks and basis risk lead to the need to
%    investigate even static hedges (=futures) with more refined
%    methods than minimum-variance based (reference to Ederington
%    here; this uses variance as risk measure and correlation as
%    dependence measure).
%  \item To capture empirical properties, extend to other risk measures
%    and dependence models. 
%  \end{itemize}
%  }

\natp{\em [The paragraph below largely repeats what has been said
  earlier. I suggest to take what is new and add it to the earlier
  paragraph. There is no need to introduce formal notation at this stage.]}
This paper considers hedging BTC using its future. % and an aggregated index of cryptocurrencies CRIX,
i.e. to find an optimal hedge ratio $h^*$ such that the risk of a hedged portfolio $r^h = r^S - h^*r^F$ has
minimal risk.
Here $r^S$ as the log return of BTC spot price, $r^F$ the log return of BTC future.
The leptokurtic properties mentioned above leads us to deploy a comprehensive way of modelling dependency namely copulae together with various risk measures as loss function to find optimal hedge ratio.
We first calibrate the log returns of BTC and CME future by copulae,
then find the optimal quantity of assets in the hedged portfolio according to a range of risk measures.
%By Sklar's theorem, we can model the margin and the dependence structure separately using copulae.
%This gives us enormous flexibility to model financial data.
\citet{barbi2014copula} use the C-convolution operator introduced by \citet{cherubini2011copula} to derive the distribution
of linear combination of margins with copula as their dependence structure.
We slightly amend their lemma and come up with a formula for the linear combination of random variables for our purpose.\medskip
%We propose a corrected expression the \citet{barbi2014copula}'s equation and propose a general expression for the density of the linear combination.
 %\natp{\em [No need to mention in the introduction that
 % the version is corrected. The main result -- that the distribution
 % function of a linear combination of random variables can be
  %expressed via the copula and margins -- remains valid.]}\medskip
%Another advantage of copulae is that they \natp{capture (was: describe)} the whole dependence structure of random variables.
%Figure \ref{fig:density illustration} illustrate the samples drawn
%from different copulae but with the same Spearman's $\rho$. \natp{\em
%  [Move this out of introduction.]}
%
%The distribution of the linear combination of margins $Z$ is also affected by the copulae.
%One can see the $Z$ of Gumbel and Clayton copula are skewed to the right and left respectively due to the
%asymmetry (radial symmetry \citet{Nelsen1999}) of copula.\natp{\em
%  [Move this out of the introduction.]}

%  This illustration shows how dependence structure modelled by different copulae affects the density of the linear combination

%\end{figure}

%Even though they reveal that SRM have some properties which cause problems when applying to practical risk management,
%they show that exponential utility function might be plausible in some circumstances under weak conditions \citealp{buhlmann1980economic}.

%However, it still causes some problems to capture the behaviors of investors when the value of absolute risk aversion (ARA) parameter beyond a threshold \citealp{markowitz2014mean}.
%If the relative risk aversion coefficients (RRA) are less than 1, \citet{dowd2008spectral} address that the weighting of lower risk-averse is higher than the higher risk-averse as the loss of portfolio increases.
%On the other hand, the power SRM proposed by \citet{dowd2008spectral} when the relative risk aversion coefficients (RRA) are larger than 1, has also proper features to give a higher weight as loss increase.
%Note that the selection of the utility function and the value of risk aversion parameter would be the matters of solving specific financial problem.
%By contrast, the estimation of the VaR and the ES are conditional on the confidence level which is not easy to determine.
%Since SRM is capable of reflecting the investor's attitude toward risk and has been applied to various fields of financial decision making, this paper apply to the determination of the optimal hedge ratio.
%It is important for the hedger who should choose a proper value for the hedge ratio in order to minimize the risk of portfolio.\\
%
%A joint distribution of spot and futures has been specified in terms of a copula function to embody the tail behaviors of the spot and the futures \citealp{barbi2014copula}.
%Copulae enable us to build the flexible multivariate distributions of dependence structure.
%This paper conducts four types of copulae (Gaussian, t, Frank, Clayton, and Normal Inverse Gaussian) to derive the copula representation of quantities to reach copula-based SRM of the hedged portfolio.
%It should be noted that the Clayton copula can be also used to construct the joint distribution with right tail dependence. Frank copula is symmetric and appropriate for data that exhibit weak or no tail dependence. Normal Inverse Gaussian (NIG) copula is a flexible system of joint distribution that includes fat-tailed and skewed distributions. However, there is still no evidence yet for selecting an exclusive copula in applications of hedging.\\
%
%An optimal hedge ratio represents the investor's subjective marginal rate of substitution between risk and return. \citet{cecchetti1988estimation} found that the optimal hedge ratios increases when an investor with a greater risk aversion by maximizing the expected value of the logarithm of wealth.
%It is understandable if a investor's attitude is more risk-averse, they will increase the position of futures contracts to hedging the uncertain risk which they may take in the future.
%On the contrary, \citet{brandtner2015decision} address that the theoretical result predictions for the subset of exponential and power SRMs are not reasonable but may be counter-intuitive if the corresponding parameter of risk aversion is large enough.
%Different from \citet{brandtner2015decision}, we consider the joint distribution of financial assets to choose the optimal hedge ratio by minimizing SRM.
%However, the empirical result shows the direction of optimal hedge ratio is increasing as the parameters represents the investors' attitude increases. \\

%This paper has two main contributions to the existing literature. First, we reveal the quantiles of loss function built by different copulae. Second, by minimizing exponential SRM (ESRM) to determine the optimal hedge ratio, we give a guidance on the choice of risk aversion function to assist the risk manager in choosing an optimal risk aversion function for a portfolio. To our knowledge, these have received no attention so far in the published literatures.\\

This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the notion of optimal hedge ratio; section 3 decribes the method of estimation of copulae; section 4 provides the empirical result; section 5 concludes.\medskip
