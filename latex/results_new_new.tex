\subsection{An overview of the hedged portfolios without the copula selection step}\label{subsec:HP1}
First, we analyse the results of hedged portfolios without the copula
selection step in order to get a better understanding of how a copula
affects the hedged portfolio with various risk minimization
objectives.
To do so, we inspect the hedge performance of copulas by
the mean square error and lower semi-variance.
The mean square error
is the distance between a perfect hedge and the hedged portfolio
returns $\operatorname{MSE}= \mbox{\sf E} (R^2)$.
The lower semi-variance is defined as 
$\operatorname{LSV}=\mbox{\sf E} \{R-\mbox{\sf E}(R)^2\}1(R\leq \mbox{\sf E}(R))$.
All results presentedd here are out-of-sample results obtained without
the copula selection step in order to compare the performances across
copulae.

%\textcolor{darkblue}{As presented in Fig 3 and 4, either individual cryptos or indice, their cumulative returns dropped in Mar 2020. it's due to the result of COVID19. we can explain this for these two plots.}\\
%\textcolor{darkblue}{Here i think it should insert a paragraph to interpret how you enter the copulae, otherwise it's weird that comes to Fig 5 and 6.}\\

Figure \ref{fig:MSE_BTC} and \ref{fig:SLV_BTC} are the mean square
error and lower semivariance of BTC-BTCF. We can see that the Frank copula
is the worst performing copula: 
the resulting hedged portfolio returns is far away from a perfect
hedge. \natp{\em [I think I did the plots on a log-scale to see some
  more detail. Can you try this? Or would you like me to do this?]}
In Figures \ref{fig:MSE_other} and \ref{fig:SLV_other}, the phenomenom
of Frank copula being inferior to its counterparts can be observed
from the results of the CRIX, BITX, BITW100, and BITW20-BTCF
portfolios. 
Interestingly, the spot in those portfolios usually have a strong
dependence with the BTCF.
In contrast, the inferiority of the Frank copula is less prominent in
the BITW70, ADA, ETH, LTC and XRP-BTCF portfolios. 
We suspect that the Frank copula is not a choice to model assets with
strong dependence.

We can also observe from Figures \ref{fig:MSE_other} and
\ref{fig:SLV_other} that theGumbel copula is not performing as well as 
other copulas in the ETH, LTC, and XRP-BTCF portfolios. 
The reason is the Gumbel copula has only upper tail dependence,
while the ETH, LTC, and XRP exhibit lower tail dependence with BTCF. 
We will discuss this in the following section.

\subsection{Copula Selection Results}\label{subsec:-copula-results}
\begin{table}[t]
\include{_tables/copulaeselectiontable}
    \label{tab:copulasection}
\end{table}
Next, we inspect the copula selection result by the AIC procedure described in section~\ref{subsec:copula-selection}.
Although the copula selection is only an intermediate step to obtain the OHRs,
the result of this step can help us better understand the dependence
feature between BTCF and the assets we study in this work.
This gives us valuable information to model the assets in the future.
Decisions of the AIC procedure are summarised in Table \ref{tab:copulasection}.

Overall, the $t$-copula, rotated Gumbel (rotGumbel), and the NIG
factor copula are the most frequently chosen copulae by the AIC
procedure.

The $t$-copula is frequently chosen to model the dependence between
the BTC and BTC-involving-indices, CRIX, BITX, BITW100, and the BTC
future.
BTC and BTC-involving-indices exhibit strong (upper and lower) tail
dependence with BTCF.  We interpret tail dependence as a strong
tendency for one asset to be extreme when another is extreme and
vice versa \citep{McNeil2015}.
In fact, the $t$ copula has been suggested in various empirical
studies to model financial data, such as~\cite{zeevi2002beyond} and~
\cite{breymann2003dependence}.
Those studies suggest that the $t$-copula is a better model compared
to the Gaussian copula as financial data typically exhibit heavy tails
and tail dependence. \textcolor{darkblue}{(because the thick and left
  skew  properties of financial data tail distribution are documented. )}
\medskip

On the other hand, the radial symmetry of the $t$-copula appears to be
a poor choice to model the remaining hedging pairs.
\cite{demarta2005t} describe the radial symmetry feature of the $t$-copula ``strong'' as it is a radially symmetric distribution.
To be specific, if $(U_1, ..., U_d)$ is a vector distributed in $t$-copula,
then $(U_1, ..., U_d) \overset{\mathcal{L}}= (1-U_1, ...,
1-U_d)$.
This symmetry can be justified in the dependence structure between a
futures and its underlying by the theory of futures pricing,
which suggests the price of a futures is a function of the underlying
price \citep{hull2003options}.
However, there is no such relationship between a futures and an asset
which is not the underlying.
Besides, asset prices tend to crash simultaneously whereas positive development is more idiosyncratic. \medskip

Among the three popular copulae, rotGumbel copula shows its ability to model the dependence between ETH and BTCF.
rotGumbel also performs well when modelling dependence between XRP, BITW20, BITW70, and the BTCF.
In particular, the whole time series of the two indices, BITW20 and BITW70, are best fitted solely with the rotated Gumbel copula. \medskip

In fact, Clayton's AIC in many of the training sets is the second lowest, just higher than that of rotated Gumbel.
This is because the Clayton copula has the same ability to model the lower quantile dependence.
However, Clayton's radial like feature does not match the behaviour of
the financial data. \medskip

It is worth to mention that although the NIG factor copula is penalised heavily due to its three parameters setup,
it is frequently chosen to be the best copula to model the dependence
between individual cryptos and the BTC future.
An extreme case would be ADA, where only NIG factor is chosen in our dataset.
Another dependence structure being best described by the NIG factor
copula is the pair of LTC-BTCF, with
64 out of 112 training sets best fitted by the NIG factor copula.
Indices like BITX and CRIX are sometimes best fitted with the NIG
factor copula as well, accounting for modelling 12 and 27 training
sets respectively.
The popularity of the NIG factor copula reflects the ability of the copula to
model very complex dependence structure: the
NIG factor copula is able to model the tail, radial asymmetry, and
off-diagonal (the region away from the diagonal line $(0,0)$ to
$(1,1)$, see figure \ref{fig:copulaeScatterPlot}) behaviour. \natp{\em
  [I think you did not understand my comment. It is clear what the
  ``off-diagonal'' is. It is unclear what is meant by ``off-diagonal
  behaviour''. Do you mean extremes on the other diagonal? Do you mean
  a cloud of points away from the diagonal? Not sure what the NIG
  factor copula is capable of modelling in this respect. Perhaps you
  have a reference?]}
  


The Frank copula is generally not a good choice to model financial
data (as also reported by \cite{barbi2014copula}).
Plackett is characterised by its dependence parameter being equal to
the cross-product ratio % \citep{joe1997multivariate}
. \natp{\em [Provide
  reference to Equation (32).]}
However, apparently, this property does not capture the dependence
structure of cryptos and BTCF.


\subsection{Hedged portfolios with the copula selection step}\label{subsec:HP2}
\begin{table}[t] \centering
    \include{_tables/BTC_rh}
    \caption{Summary statistics of BTC-BTCF hedge portfolios out-of-sample daily returns under different risk minimisation objectives.}
\label{tab:BTCrh}
\end{table}
Table~\ref{tab:BTCrh} presents the summary statistics, maximum drawdown (MD) and the date of MD of the BTC-BTCF hedge portfolios.
The index column indicates the risk minimization objectives.
We observe that the statistics of the portfolios with different objectives are similar to each other.
The means of the returns are close to zero;
Standard deviations ranges from 0.32\% to 0.35\%;
Skewnesses are slightly negative (skew to the right);
Kurtosises are slightly larger than 3;
The MDs are close to zero and the date of MDs are 2020-11-30.

For the other spots \natp{\em [Do you mean cryptocurrencies? Or all
  hedges? Then maybe use the word ``instruments to be hedged'' or ``instruments''.]}, tables~\ref{tab:var_rh} to table~\ref{tab:ERM_rh} summarise the statistics
of daily returns of hedged portfolios.  \natp{\em [Table and Figure if
  you reference them directly.]} \natp{\em [Why are the tables
  oversized? Bring them down to normal size.]} \natp{\em [Also, think
  carefully what VaR 5\% means. If you are taking the 5\% quantile of
  P\&L data, then it's VaR 95\%.]}
The tables look repeating so we place them in the appendix. \natp{\em
  [I suggest to throw out skewness and kurtosis and place everything in one
  table, landscape. Otherwise, the reader will need to scroll back and
  forth in order to compare (or decide to just ignore the tables).]}
For each hedge portfolios,
the first four moments as well as the maximum drawdown (MD) and the date of MD are very similar across different risk minimization objectives. \natp{\em [delete this sentence, it is obvious.]}
%This is because the optimal hedge ratios of different risk minimization objectives fall into a small range. \medskip

On the other hand, the statistics vary across spots.
Unsurprisingly, the BTC-involved spots, i.e. BTC, CRIX, BITX, and BITW100, are well hedged by the BTCF regardless of risk minimization objective.
Contrarily, BTC-not-involved spots' portfolios are less promising.
Th hedged portfolio returns are as volatile as the spots. \natp{\em [Where do we see this? I suggest to add a row
  ``unhedged'', this would be very informative.]}
We will further discuss the effectiveness of hedge in the next section. %\ref{sec: HE results}.

\subsection{Hedging Effectiveness Results}\label{sec: HE results}
\begin{figure}[t]
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{_pics/ES5_HE_boxplot.pdf}
  \caption{Hedging effectiveness (HE) of portfolios with different risk minimizatio objectives evaluated by the corresponding risk minimization objectives.
            The boxplots indicate the the median, upper quartile, lower quartile, minimium and maximum of the bootstrapped HE.
            The HE of BTC-involved spots are significantly higher than that of BTC-not-involved spots.
  \href{http://www.quantlet.com/}{\includegraphics[height=\baselineskip]{_pics/qletlogo_tr.png}} }
\label{fig:HEboxplot}
\end{figure}
In this section, we analyse the out-of-sample hedging effectiveness (HE) of BTCF as hedging.
HE is defined as $$\text{HE} = 1-\frac{\rho_h}{\rho_s},$$
a measure of the percentage reduction of portfolio risk attribute, in our case the spot $\rho_s$,
to hedged portfolio risk attribute $\rho_h$.
A higher HE indicates a higher hedging effectiveness and larger risk reduction. \medskip

The HE above is a generalisation of Ederington measure  \natp{\em [What is the Ederington measure? This is not a
  known name, no reader will know what you mean. Provide a
  reference to the Ederington paper, but the measure itself could
  be compared to $R^2$.]} of hedging performance, where we,
in addition to variance, include other risk measures: Expected
Shortfall 5\% and 1\% (ES5 and ES1), Value-at-Risk 5\% and 1\% (VaR5
and VaR1), and ERM. \natp{\em [Again: ES95\%, ES99\%, etc.]}
In particular, ES5 is recommended by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) to replace VaR as a quantitative risk metrics system.
The proposed reform aimed at enhancing the risk metric system's ability to capture tail risk. \natp{\em [Delete last two
  sentences. The change is already implemented, but the statement is
  out of place here. Place it where the risk measures are introduced.]} 
%Discussions of the issue can be found in literatures.
%

\natp{\em [What's going on here? Is this for the calculation of the
  HE? So far, the reader thinks that HE will be given as a number, but
  has no clue that you want to show HE distributions. Explain this
  first. ]}
We obtain a time series of out-of-sample $r^h$ of each hedging pair and each risk reduction objective by concatenating the out-of-sample results.
Then, we apply stationary block bootstrapping (SB) to the time series introduced by \cite{Politis1994} in our analysis in order to preserve the temporal structure of the data while sampling.
The SB procedure is as follow. \natp{\em [SB is never used again, so
  get rid of abbreviation.]}
Assume a time series with $N$ observations $\{X_t\}_{t \in [1,N]}$ is a strong stationary, weakly dependence time series of interest,
we form blocks of samples $B = \{X_i, ..., X_{i+j-1}\}$.
Index $i$ is a random variable uniformly distributed over
$[1,2,...,N]$ and $j$ is geometric distributed random variable with
parameter . \natp{\em [What parameter?]} 
The block index $i$ and block length $j$ are independent.
For any index $k$ which is greater than $N$, the sample $X_k$ is defined to be $X_{k(\mod N)}$.
For each block, we calculate the hedging effectiveness with different risk measures mentioned above.
We choose $p=0.005$, implying the expected block length is 200.
100 blocks are drawn for each risk minimising objective and
spot. \natp{\em [You need to go over this again. There are many
  grammatical errors in there that need to be fixed. Also explain that
  expected block length is 200 so that ES99\% and VaR99\% can be
  calculated. Is the hedge ratio calculated for each sample drawn,
  etc.? ]}


From figure \ref{fig:HEboxplot}, we report, as expected, the BTC
involving spots, the BTC, CRIX, BITX and BITW100, are well hedged by
the BTCF. \natp{\em [fix.]}
The performances are consistent across different risk reduction objectives and different HE evaluation.
The median HE to BTC generated by various risk reduction objectives is ranging from 89.45\% to 99.31\%, median HE to CRIX is ranging from 81.13\% to 95.22\%,
median HE to BITX is ranging from 79.06\% to 94.84\%, median HE to BITW100 Is ranging from 71.07\% to 92.98\%.  \natp{\em[It does not
  make sense to compare across different risk measures, so I suggest
  to delete the last statement. How can HE be negative??? Especially
  for variance this is impossible.]}

The HE of BTCF to other cryptos and indices are substantially lower than to the BTC involving spots, but the consistency the performances across different risk reduction objectives and HE evaluation remains.
The median HE to BITW20 generated by various risk reduction objectives is ranging from 24.67\% to 47.02\%, median HE to BITW70 is ranging from 23.61\% to 49.30\%,
median HE to ADA is ranging from 9.01\% to 29.30\%, median HE to ETH Is ranging from 30.07\% to 36.18\%, median HE to LTC Is ranging from 37.74\% to 51.30\%,
median HE to XRP Is ranging from 0.46\% to 30.89\%. \natp{\em [Same as
  before.]}

\natp{\em [We need some proper conclusions here.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item It is noticable that the HE of variance is highest.
  \item Comparing ES95\% and ES99\%, it is seen that ES95\%
    performs better. This is an indication that tail risk remmains
    despite hedging. 
  \end{itemize}
  ]}

\natp{\em [A general conclusion is needed. That ES95\% / Var95\%
  perform better than their 99\% counterparts is also evident from
  Figures 7 and 8. So focussing on tail risk by choosing an extreme tail risk
  measure does not lead to a promising hedge. Also variance performs
  well, especially for the lower correlated instruments /
  indices. Var95\% also performs well across all copulas. Please check
  if the tables in the appendix confirm this.\\
  Main conclusion is that the choice of copula highlights the 
  differences in the instruments / indices and their relationships
  with the futures contract. Unfortunately, we see that the copula
  choice does not always lead to the best hedge (see e.g.\ ADA), where
  Frank, Gaussian, Plackett and rotGumbel perform much better in
  terms of MSE. I suspect that has to do with the fact that hedging is
  necessarily linear, so a better copula model may not necessarily
  attain a better (linear) hedge. This means that the copula selection
  results should be taken as interesting by themselves. Also, they
  might be useful if using more than one hedge instrument, e.g.\ by
  including options as hedge instruments.]}
