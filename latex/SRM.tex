\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}
Cryptocurrencies (CC's) are a fast-growing asset class,
with many more CCs now available on the market since the first
cryptocurrency Bitcoin (BTC) surfaced \citep{nakamoto2009}.
In response to the rapid development of the CC market, the CME Group
launched exchange-traded BTC futures contracts in December
2017.
At the time of writing, the CME is the only exchanged offering
regulated crypto futures. 
As per the CME report on 25th of Nov, 2022, the average daily volume and open interest of the CME BTC futures are
\$1,220M and \$1,357M respectively \footnote{Data from CME: \url{https://www.cmegroup.com/ftp/bitcoinfutures/Bitcoin_Futures_Liquidity_Report_20221202.pdf}}.
Because it is regulated, the CME BTC derivatives market  
is an attractive way for institutional
investors to participate in or manage their exposure in the crypto
market.
%The price
%of BTC even surged to \$ 64,500 in mid-April 2021 up by 460\% from
% from \$ 11,500 six months earlier in October 2020 and up by 850\%
% from a year earlier. Just a month later, by mid-May 2021, the price
% had fallen to \$ 50,000, a one-month return of -22.5\%.
 % see tiingo_btc.csv 
As more individual and institutional investors are adding CCs and CC
derivatives to their portfolios, the need to understand
downside risks and find suitable ways to hedge against extreme risks
is created. 
Fom a risk management perspective, the roller-coaster ride
of crypto prices may create significant basis risk, even when using
simple hedges involving crypto portfolios and BTC futures. This
requires analysing the dependence structure of cryptos and
futures beyond linear correlation. 

In this paper, we examine static hedges of crypto portfolios
with Bitcoin futures. Owing to the asymmetry of crypto returns as
well as the occurrence of extreme events, we consider different 
dependence structures via a variety of copula models. We then optimise
the hedge ratio using different risk measures. A similar study was
conducted by \citep{barbi2014copula} for equity and FX portfolios.
\citet{barbi2014copula}'s work is based on \citet{cherubini2011copula}
to derive the distribution of linear combinations of margins with
copulae describing the dependence structure. We slightly extend their
results and come up with a formula for the linear combination of
random variables for our purpose.

The hedge ratio is the appropriate amount of futures contracts to hold
in order to eliminate the risk exposure in the underlying security.   
The determination of the optimal hedge ratio relies primarily
on the dependence between BTC and futures prices.
%In this paper, we investigate the performance of different copulae and
%risk measures in hedging Bitcoin and CRIX with Bitcoin
%futures. {\color{blue} only this portfolio?} \natp{\em [$\leftarrow$ Make this the first sentence of the paper!]}
Financial asset returns have long known to be non-Gaussian, see e.g.\
\citep{fama1963mandelbrot,Cont2001}. Specifically, Gaussian models
cannot produce the heavy tails and the asymmetry observed in 
asset returns, which in turn implies a consistent underestimation of
financial risks. 
%\natp{\cite{Cont2001}}. \natp{\em [non-Gaussian is not
  %very specific, a uniform r.v.\ is also non-Gaussian. Try to express
 % this in a more meaningful way, e.g.\ Financial data are known to
  %exhibit more extreme events than a normal distribution can capture.]}
Therefore, to minimize downside risk, one cannot solely rely on
second-order moment calculations. Moreover, variance as a risk measure
does not account for the variety of investors' utility functions. In
particular, it is known that  
investors are tail-risk averse, see \cite{menezes1980increasing}.
Copulae provide the flexibility to model multivariate random variables
separately by their margins and dependence structure.
The concept of copulae was originally developed (but not under this
name) by Wassily Hoeffding \citep{hoeffding1940masstabinvariante}
and later popularised by the work of Abe Sklar \citep{Sklar1959}.

Different risk measures account for investors' risk attitudes.
They serve as loss functions in the search process of the optimal
hedge ratio. Of the vast literature discussing the relationship between
risk measures and investors' risk attitudes, we refer readers to
\citet{artzner1999coherent} for an axiomatic 
approach of risk measure construction;
\citet{embrechts2002correlation} for reasoning of using expected
shortfall (ES) and spectral risk measures (SRM) in addition to
value-at-risk (VaR);
\citet{Acerbi2002} for direct linkages between risk measures and
investor's risk attitudes using the concept of a ``risk aversion
function''. 


In order to capture a variety of risk preferences, in addition to
variance, we include the risk measures value-at-risk (VaR), expected
shortfall (ES), and spectral risk measures (SRM). 
%Coherency is a very natural property that suggest diversification will reduce risk.
VaR is widely used by the finance industry and easy to understand. 
ES and SRM are chosen because of their coherence property, in
particular, they recognize diversification benefits.
SRM can also be directly related to an individual's utility function.
Examples are the exponential SRM and power SRM introduced by
\citet{dowd2008spectral}. 
%\natp{\em [Careful with wording! The
 %hedge is not optimal. The optimal hedge ratio that minimises a risk measure is chosen.]}
%In particular, the SRM proposed by \citet{Acerbi2002} accounts for investors' utility (i.e. risk preference).
%SRM is a weighted average of the quantities of a loss distribution, the weights of which depend on the investor's risk-aversion. In other words, 

% \natp{\em [This needs not go in the introduction. Just briefly mention the risk measures, and possibly that ES and SRM are chosen because of their coherence.]}

%  \item 1-2 sentence: Which problem is solved in this paper?
%  \item Background Bitcoin: Growth, but roller-coaster ride, institutional investment,

%  \item To capture empirical properties, extend to other risk measures
%    and dependence models. 
%  \end{itemize}

In this work, we study the effectiveness of hedging various CC's and
crypto indices using Bitcoin futures under copula models and different
risk preferences. 
In an extensive back-test,\footnote{We thank the data provider
  Tiingo (\href{https://www.tiingo.com/}{https://www.tiingo.com/}) for
  providing the crypto price data.}
 we find the ability of the BTC futures to hedge BTC and BTC-related
 indices promising, regardless of the choices of the copula (with the
 exception of the Frank copula) and risk measure. 
On the other hand, the ability of BTC futures to hedge other cryptos and crypto indices
is affected by idiosyncratic factors such as regulatory factors and operational risk,
but the overall CEM BTCF hedging effectiveness to other cryptos and crypto indices is far lower
than that to BTC.
We discuss the characteristics of the hedged portfolios contructed by range of risk measures-copulae pairs.


The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the notion of
an optimal hedge ratio; Section 3 decribes the method of estimation of
copulae; Section 4 provides the empirical result; Section 5
concludes.

\section{Conclusion and Outlook}\label{sec:conclusion-and-outlook}
We study the effectiveness of hedging cryptos and crypto indices with
Bitcoin futures.
To accomodate different risk appetites and scenarios, a variety of
commonly used risk measures are considered to determine the optimal
hedge ratio. The risk measures comprise variance, value-at-risk at
the confidence levels 95\% and 99\%, expected shortfall 95\% and 99\%,
and the exponential risk measure with parameter $k=10$.

At the time of writing, the crypto market is a vibrant and
fast-developing market, causing cryptos to have complex and
time-changing dependence structures with the Bitcoin futures.
As a consequence, the dependence between the cryptos and the futures
contract plays an important role in hedging as it determines the
distribution of the portfolio returns. We therefore consider various
copulae, a flexible statistical tool that separates modelling of the
marginals and the dependence structure of multivariate random
vectors. To address the potential time-changing dependence, we
periodically re-calibrate the copula models and determine the
best-fitting copula via AIC. 

An extensive out-of-sample backtest suggests that Bitcoin futures
are consistently capable of hedging BTC and BTC-involved indices,
i.e., BITX, CRIX, and BITW100, under different risk minimisation
objectives 
and copula models. The mean-square errors (MSEs) and lower
semi-variances (LSVs) of the resulting portfolios are
indistinguishable at a low level except for the Frank copula. 
For BTC-related spot asset, the AIC procedure consistently
favours the $t$-copula because it  
captures the tail dependence feature of the data. 
Compared to the unhedged cases, the
portfolios' out-of-sample maximum drawdowns are significantly reduced. 

Contrarily, we observe more diverse results of the capability of BTC
futures to hedge other cryptos and crypto indices that exclude Bitcoin. 
In general, ES 95\% and VaR 95\% perform better than their 99\%
in terms of mean square error (MSE) and lower semi variance (LSV).
In particular, minimising ES 99\% leads to relatively
high MSEs and LSVs regardless of the copula in use. The ES 99\% and
VaR 99\% even result in out-of-sample maximum drawdowns that are
higher than that of the 95\% counterparts in some portfolios, 
for example in the ETH- and LTC-BTCF portfolios.
Therefore, we conclude that overly emphasising tail risks by choosing
extreme tail risk measures does not lead to a promising hedge in a
cross-hedging setting. 

As an intemediate step in determining the optimal hedge ratio, 
the AIC procedure mainly favours the rotated Gumbel and the NIG
factor copula in modelling non-BTC relate cryptos and indices. This
reflects the systematic nature of 
downward movements in the crypto market. Interestingly, the best-fitting
copula does not necessary lead to the best performing portfolio in
terms of MSE or LSV. This is the case, for example, for ADA. 
We suspect that this discrepancy between the optimal copula selection and
MSE-LSV results can be attributed to the static linear nature of the
hedge, as the sole hedge instrument is a futures contract; the
hedge is not sophisticated enough to react to the more involved
dependence structure.

% \section{Discussion}\label{sec:discussion}

% \natp{\em [What is the goal of the discussion? If I remember correctly
%   we wanted to mention that we use CME data as we have an
%   institutional trader as a market maker in mind. This should go into
%   the introduction. If you want to include policy makers, can you
%   summarise this in a few sentences? Otherwise, we should leave this
%   out, as we are not aiming at policy advice in this paper.]}

% \textit{Cryptohedgers}: Our results and conclusion are drawn using a non-parametric way, kernel density estimation,
% to fit the marginal density of the crypto and futures returns because we intend to leave the modelling of marginal distributions flexible and generic.
% Copula provides the flexibility to model marginal distributions separately.
% That means the model assumption and parametrisation for spot and futures can be different.
% This empowers hedgers to make use of variety of statistical tools to model the marginal distributions according to asset specific features they are interested,
% to enhance the model predictability, and hence, to improve the hedging effectiveness.
% For example, one can use various types of GARCH to deal with clustered volatility observed from the spot while using structural time series to deal with seasonality in futures;
% alternatively, using Hawkes processes to deal with clustered jumps in spots and futures without modelling the spillover or co-jumps in the marginal distribution.
% Hedgers are allowed to be creative in this regard. In fact, many researchers have enriched the understanding of the crypto market dynamics,
% see for example \citet{kaiser2019seasonality}, \citet{gyamerah2022modelling}, and \citet{mark2022quantifying}.
% Although the hedging effectiveness of combining various statistical tools with copula remain an open question,
% our analysis shows that hedgers have the freedom to choose the copula (except the Frank copula) to model the dependence structure,
% whereas t, Plackett, Gaussian Mix independent, rotated Gumbel and NIG copula appear to be conservative choices to start the analysis.

With further analysis, the conclusion drawn from this study can also be applied to crypto market related policy making.
Our results connect to the discussion of whether authority should allow crypto futures hedge as basis to lower the minimum capital requirements inflicted by crypto exposure.
While the debates carry on at the time of writing, our results align and can be seen as an extension of the existing researches made by stakeholders,
for example, research done by CME \footnote{See the CME and KPMG's reports on \url{https://www.cmegroup.com/education/files/basics-of-hedge-effectiveness.pdf}},
and International Swaps and Derivatives Association's report \footnote{See the ISDA report "Crypto-asset Risks and Hedging Analysis" on \url{https://www.isda.org/a/pMWgE/Crypto-asset-Risks-and-Hedging-Analysis.pdf }}.
Nonetheless, further studies are required to rule out or understand the risks other than market risk, e.g. operation risk and counterparty risk. 

On the other hand, our results provide partial evidences in supporting seperate treatments of cryptos with a matured regulated derivatives market and those without. 
Our results show a clear distinction between the hedging effectiveness of BTC futures to BTC related assets and BTC unrelated assets. 
Hedgers are empowered by the BTC futures to manage their BTC and BTC-related exposure, but not the other crypto exposures.
Further studies are required to generalise the hedging effectiveness of other crypto-futures pairs.

% The Basel chair's stand on placing tough capital rules for crypto assets \footnote{See \url{https://www.risk.net/regulation/7948536/basel-chair-stands-by-tough-capital-rules-for-crypto-assets}} attracted discussion.

% - .65 \min\left(

% even for VaR99\% and ES99\%, can be effectively reduced by an appropriate size of opposite position in CME BTC futures.

% In the Second Consultation, Group 2 cryptoassets (Group 1 CCs are digitally tokenised traditional assets) are divided into two subcategories,
% Group 2a are the CCs that exists a derivative or exchange-traded fund (ETF)/exchange-traded note (ETN) that is traded on a regulated exchange that solely references the cryptoasset;
% Group 2b are the CCs that fail to meet the requirement.
% Our results suggest that the existence of derivative that solely references the cryptoasset empowers market participants to hedge their corresponding crypto position,
% thus it is sensible to treat the aforementioned Group 2a and 2b differently.
% On the contrary, we show that the hedging effectiveness significantly lower than 1 when the spot is different from what the CME futures is referencing, i.e. the cross hedge setting.
% That means the risk of holding a CC cannot be perfectly cross hedged by including the CME futures.
% Even worse, we observe negative HEs in some of the bootstrapped samples.
% From the great difference in hedging effectiveness between the BTC-BTCF and other cross hedge portfolios,
% we conclude that the existance of derivative that solely reference the cryptoasset is a sensible choice of crtyptoassets categorisation criteria
% as it reflects assessibility of market participants to form risk reduction strategy.

\section{Density of linear combination of random variables}
\label{sec:appendix}
\begin{proposition}
   Let $\bm{X} = (X_1, ..., X_d)^\top$ be real-valued random variables with corresponding
   copula density $\bm{c}_{X_1, ..., X_d}$, and continuous marginals $F_{X_1}, ..., F_{X_d}$.
   Then, the
   pdf of the linear combination of marginals $Z = n_1 \cdot X_1 +
   ... +  n_d \cdot X_d $ is
   \begin{align}
   f_Z(z) &= \left| n_1^{-1} \right| \int_{[0,1]^{d-1}} \bm{c}_{X_1,...,X_d}
      \left(F_{X_1} (S(z)), u_2, ..., u_d \right) \cdot
      f_{X_1} (S(z)) \dd u_2 ... \dd u_d, \label{density}
   \end{align}
   with
   \begin{align*}
      S(z) &= \frac{1}{n_1}\cdot z - \frac{n_2}{n_1} \cdot F^{(-1)}_{X_2}(u_2) - ... -  \frac{n_d}{n_1} \cdot F^{(-1)}_{X_d}(u_d).
      \end{align*}
   \end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
  Let
    \[\mathbf A=\displaystyle \begin{bmatrix}
      n_1    & n_2  & \cdots &    & n_d     \\
      0      & 1    & \cdots  &    & 0       \\
      0      & 0    & 1 &  \cdots & 0       \\
      \vdots &      & & \ddots & \vdots \\
      0      & \cdots &       & 1  \\
    \end{bmatrix}.\]
    Then,
    \begin{equation*}
      \begin{bmatrix}
        Z \\ X_2 \\ \vdots \\ X_d
      \end{bmatrix}
      = \bm{A}
      \begin{bmatrix}
         X_1 \\ X_2 \\ \vdots \\ X_d
      \end{bmatrix}.
    \end{equation*}

   By transformation of the variables~\citep[Section 4.3]{hardle2019applied},
   \begin{align*}
      \bm{f}_{Z,X_2,...,X_d}(z, x_2, ...,x_d) &= \bm{f}_{X_1,...,X_d}\left( \bm{A}^{-1}
      \begin{bmatrix}
         z \\ x_2 \\ \vdots \\ x_d
      \end{bmatrix}
      \right)  \cdot |\det \bm{A}^{-1}| \\
      &= \left| n_1^{-1} \right| \bm{f}_{X_1,...,X_d}\left(S(z), x_2,...,x_d\right).
      \end{align*} \medskip

   Let $u_i = F_{X_i}(x_i)$. By chain rule we have
   \begin{align*}
       \bm{f}_{X_1,...,X_d}(x_1,...,x_d) &= \frac{\partial^d F_{X_1,...,X_d}(x_1, ..., x_d)}{\partial x_1 ... \partial x_d}\\
                                         &= \bm{c}_{X_1,...,X_d}(u_1, ..., u_d) \cdot \prod_{i=1}^d f_{X_i}(x_i).
   \end{align*}

    Therefore,
   \begin{align*}
      \bm{f}_{Z,X_2,...,X_d}&(z, x_2, ...,x_d) = \\
       \left| n_1^{-1} \right| &\cdot
      \bm{c}_{X_1,...,X_d}\left(F_{X_1}( S(z)), u_2, ...,  u_d\right)  \cdot
      f_{X_1} \{ S(z) \} \cdot
      \prod_{i=2}^d f_{X_i}(x_i).
      \end{align*}

   The claim (\ref{density}) is obtained by integrating out $x_2, ... x_d$ by substituting $\dd x_i = \frac{1}{f_{X_i}(x_i)} \dd u_i$.
   \end{proof}

\section{Supplementary Material: Intraday Hedging}\label{sec:intraday}

% \natp{\em [This section must be shortened significantly. It is not
%   necessary to repeat everything, just point out the differences.]}

% This supplementary material extends the study in the main body to an
% intraday rebalancing setting. \natp{\em [Do we really have intraay
%   rebalancing? Or just intraday P\&L? If rebalancing, then clarify.]}
Here we extend the hedging effectiveness analysis to intraday data again through backtesting.
BTC and ETH are chosen as spot to be hedged against by BTCF. 
The backtesting procedure in this section is the same to that of the main body, except the followings:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item recalibration and rebalancing frequency are increased to every 4 hours,
  \item lengths of training data and test data are changed to 336 (equivant to 14 days) and 4 respectively, and
  \item the stationary bootstrapping parameters are changed to $p=1/4, T=336, S=1000$ to adapt to the new rebalancing frequency. 
\end{enumerate}

The increased recalibration and rebalancing frequency require data with higher granularity that CME does not provide, 
forcing us to backtest with data from other crypto exchanges.

We collect price data from Deribit from 2020-06-01 00:00 UTC to 2020-08-01 00:00 UTC. 
All price data are hourly data.
The Deribit contract BTC-25SEP20 represents BTCF;
the Deribit BTC and ETH index represent the spot of BTC and ETH, respectively.
We take the hourly closing mid-price of the BTC-25SEP20 as the futures price and the last value of the BTC and ETH index in every hourly bucket as the spot prices.
Since the date range of the data is fully covered by the lifetime of BTC-25SEP20, this study does not require futures contract rollover.

Note that the exact values of MSE, LSV or HEs from the two rebalancing schedules should not be directly compared for two reasons: 1. The data are from different date ranges; 2. Various factors contribute to the difference between results from different sampling frequencies, e.g. Epps effect, microstructure noise,
and asynchronous trading.
However, we compare the patterns and conclusions to get a general understanding of the hedging issue for future use.

% \natp{\em [From my point of view there is no need to motivate intraday
%   risk management.]}
% Studying the intraday hedge is familiar to academia, 
% e.g. \citet{harris2010limits}, \citet{dungey2013impact},
% \citet{tse2013does}, and \citet{sheu2014incremental}.

% Numerous studies on the crypto market are associated with or motivated
% by the presence of intraday traders as well, 
% e.g. \citet{petukhina2021rise}, \citet{meshcheryakov2020ethereum},
% \citet{alexander2022role}, \citet{zhang2022data} and
% \citet{katsiampa2022high}. 

% \natp{(delete: We have in view to robustify the results from the main body.)}

% \begin{enumerate}
% \item form two hedging portfolios, BTC-BTCF and ETH-BTCF,
% \item simulate trades using Deribit hourly data, and
% \item rebalance every four hours.
% \end{enumerate}


% \subsubsection{Procedure}
% Starting from oldest data:
% \begin{enumerate}
%     \item Calibrate a copula by a training data of 336 datapoints, equivalent to 14 days data
%     \item Draw samples $(\tilde r_s, \tilde r_f)$ from the calibrated copula
%     \item Numerically search for $h^* = \arg \max \phi(\tilde r_s - h\tilde r_f)$ according to a risk measure $\phi$
%     \item Apply $h^*$ to testing data to yield $r_h$; the testing data is the consecutive 4 data points to training data, i.e. the 4 hours data consecutive to the last training data
%     \item Repeat the procedure for the next 4 datapoints
%     \item Concatenate $r_h$s the and sort chronologically to form a full length out-of-sample hedging portfolio returns
% \end{enumerate}

% The procedure is further repeated for all the combinations of risk measures and copulae.
% The full-length out-of-sample returns represent the corresponding performance of a particular risk measure-copula combination.
% They are used in computation mean square error (MSE) and lower-semi-variance (LSV) shown in the following section.

% The AIC selection step is performed between Steps 1 and 2 of the procedure above.
% The resulting out-of-sample returns are a mix of results from the copula that has the lowest AIC on the training data.
% We keep a record of how many times a copula is choosen by this step.
% To yield robust HE measures, we apply stationary bootstrapping to the
% full-length AIC selected out-of-sample returns with the following
% parameters: $p=1/4, T=336, S=1000$. 

% \subsection{Results}
\begin{figure}[t]
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{_pics/hourly_HE.png}
  \caption{Intraday HEs of BTC-BTCF and ETH-BTCF portfolio. The HEs of BTC-BTCF portfolios are significantly higher than $0$,
which suggests involving the BTCF in the portfolio can effectively reduce market risk.
The HEs of ETH-BTCF portfolios are lower than that of BTC-BTCF portfolios, and sometimes go below $0$.
We nullify the hedging ability of BTCF in this intraday ETH-BTCF setting.
  \href{http://www.quantlet.com/}{\includegraphics[height=\baselineskip]{_pics/qletlogo_tr.png}} }
\label{fig:HEboxplot_intraday}
\end{figure}

% \textit{Bootstrapped out-of-sample HEs}:
Figure \ref{fig:HEboxplot_intraday} presents the bootstrapped out-of-sample HEs. 
In general, the daily rebalancing results of BTC-BTCF carry over to the intraday rebalancing schedule;
The intraday rebalancing ETH-BTCF is different from its daily rebalancing counterpart.
The main difference between the intraday rebalancing and daily
rebalancing ETH-BTCF portfolio is that negative HEs appear in the
intraday results in all the risk measures we consider. 
This implies that hedgers cannot gain hedging potential from intraday dependence between BTC and ETH to hedge an ETH crypto position. 
% \natp{(delete: 
% The negative HEs suggests that BTCF should not be used to hedge against ETH in an intraday setting.
% Consider also the fact that BTCF is written on BTC instead of ETH, hedgers have no ground to assume they can take advantage of the intraday dependency structure between ETH and BTCF for hedging.
% Therefore, we mainly focus on the BTC-BTCF portfolios and mentioning
% the results of the ETH-BTCF portfolio is needed.)} 


Turning to BTC-BTCF, the HEs of BTC-BTCF are
significantly higher than zero across different risk measures,
suggesting that adding BTCF to a BTC portfolio can effectively reduce
the risk measured by selected measures.
Among risk measures, HE of variance is the highest, ranging between 72\% to 98\%, while the
  HE's other risk measures range between 25\% to 80\%.
Reducing variance being a well-achievable objective is
consistent with the findings of the daily rebalancing schedule.
On the other hand, the HEs of ES99\% and VaR99\% are relatively more dispersed and skewed to the left.
Both risk measures consider only 1\% of the data from the left for deciding the hedge ratio and computing the HEs.
Considering only a few data points naturally leads to a less reliable hedge ratio and lower consistency HEs.
Evidence also shows that ES99\% VaR99\% minimising portfolios have higher MSE and LSV.
This result is again consistent with the daily rebalancing setting.

\label{fig:BTC_LSV}
\end{figure}

Figures \ref{fig:BTC_MSE} and \ref{fig:BTC_LSV} report the
out-of-sample MSE and LSV of the BTC-BTCF when different copulae and
risk measures are in use. The MSEs and LSVs share similar patterns to that of the daily rebalancing
setting. 
Across various copulae, the BTC-BTCF portfolio that minimises VaR95\%
provides the lowest MSE and LSV. 
Portfolios that minimise variance and ERM with $k=10$ are close in MSEs and LSVs,
The MSEs and LSVs are slightly higher than that of VaR95\%, especially when Gumbel and NIG copulae
are in use to model the dependence. ES99\% generates the highest MSEs
and LSVs, regardless of the copula. 

Across various risk measures, Gumbel and NIG copulae perform
well in the resulting portfolios’ MSE and LSV, except for
ES99\%. 
The Frank copula performs worst, regardless of the risk measure. 
These results are consistent with the daily rebalancing setting and
conclusion drawn in \citet[p.667]{barbi2014copula}. 
% As Gumbel and NIG are the only copulae that can model upper
% tail dependence, this suggests that the upper tail dependence is an
% essential feature of the dependence structure for hedging.
% \natp{\em [Delete?]} The conclusion is further supported by comparing the Gumbel and the
% rotated Gumbel copula. 
% The rotated Gumbel copula is the 180-degree rotated version of the Gumbel copula, sharing all the features of the Gumbel copula but switching from modelling the lower tail dependence to upper tail dependence.
% The rotated Gumbel copula results in portfolios with higher MSEs and
% LSVs consistently across risk measures.

        }
    \label{tab:copulasection_intraday}
\end{table}

Table \ref{tab:copulasection_intraday} shows the relative frequencies
of the best fitting copula according to AIC.
They are $t$-, Plackett, Gaussian Mix Independent, rotated Gumbel and NIG.
Similar to the result in the daily rebalancing schedule, most of the time the AIC procedure chooses t-Copula to model
the dependence structure of BTC-BTCF in the intraday setting.
For the rest of the time, the NIG copula is mainly chosen.
Rotated Gumbel, Gaussian Mix Independent, and Plackett are spontaneously chosen.
On the other hand, the intraday ETH-BTCF’s AIC selection result is very different from that of the daily rebalancing.
There are three copulae: $t$-, Gaussian Mix Independent, and NIG copula, that are closely chosen, instead of a single copula, rotated Gumbel copula, dominating the list in the daily rebalancing setting.
